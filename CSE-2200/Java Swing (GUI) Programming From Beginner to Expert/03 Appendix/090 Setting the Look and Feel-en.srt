00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:02,180
Hello.

2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:06,450
This is John from caveofprogramming.com,
and

3
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:12,493
this is a extra tutorial on setting the
look and feel in Java swing.

4
00:00:12,493 --> 00:00:17,610
So I'm adding this sometime after creating
the original

5
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:21,200
swing course from cave of programming, and
this is just

6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:26,640
because this is actually something which
can at least sometimes

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,870
arguably improve the look of your swing
application a lot.

8
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:36,760
And various people have been asking me
about it so I figured it was time

9
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:40,240
to include this maybe in in an appendix

10
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,540
or something to the original set of
tutorials.

11
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:47,180
So I've got this swing application that
we've been

12
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:51,940
working on in [UNKNOWN] tutorials, and it
looks like this.

13
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:55,630
But Java actually let's you set the look
and feel of the interface.

14
00:00:55,630 --> 00:01:00,530
And by default you get this kind of swing
default kind of swing interface.

15
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:05,850
And actually although I'm running on
Windows here.

16
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:12,650
A, a swing application in my experience
never looks like a native application.

17
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:18,200
So you'll never get something that looks
completely like a Windows application.

18
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,270
And if you wanted one you would have to
use

19
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:25,159
not Swing but the somewhat similar and yet
different SWT.

20
00:01:26,535 --> 00:01:29,300
Toolkit which you can download for free.

21
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:32,180
And that actually uses native components,

22
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:36,150
rather than drawing things itself, swing
does.

23
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:41,910
However, you can change the look and feel
of swing, maybe get one you're happy with.

24
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:44,990
So if you go to Google here, and

25
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:49,550
search for swing look and feel, you'll get
information.

26
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:53,780
And go to the docs.oracle.com, site.

27
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,580
And you can, you'll find a whole page
about how to set the look and feel.

28
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:02,560
And the built in look and feels in Java
used to be all pretty

29
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:08,380
rank to tell you the truth, pretty bad,
but some of them now are pretty good.

30
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,970
So to set the look and feel you

31
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:13,550
just call UE manager.setlookandfeel and
then you pass

32
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:17,519
in the name of a class that you want to
set a look and feel to.

33
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:24,550
And you can download some professionally
designed looks and fields,

34
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:29,510
looks and feels in Java files and just put
them in the build path

35
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:32,342
of your application in the normal way and
the way that you

36
00:02:32,342 --> 00:02:38,270
does any [UNKNOWN] by sort of
right-clicking and going to build path.

37
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:42,380
Configure build path and add a jar,
external jar.

38
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:46,070
And and then you can set the, the looks

39
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:49,240
and feels to those using an appropriate
class name.

40
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:54,110
But let's look here at just the built in
ones, so I'll try setting this.

41
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:57,620
And see that this is gonna be, well I
would say pretty bad.

42
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:01,180
I'm gonna go to the constructor of my main
frame here,

43
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:05,030
and just paste this in and it throws a
bunch of exceptions.

44
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:09,140
So I'm gonna surround with try catch, in
fact

45
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:12,450
I'm just gonna change the first one here
to exception.

46
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:17,170
And get rid of all the others because I'll
catch all these exceptions just

47
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:21,930
by trying to catch exception here which is
the parent class of all exceptions.

48
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:24,190
And let's just put a sys out here and say

49
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:30,360
can't set look and feel, just in case that
fails.

50
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,400
And I'll run this.

51
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,140
So I'm setting it a metal look and feel

52
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:37,880
just by specifying this class name that
I've got.

53
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,180
Got from a documentation and if I run

54
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:45,280
that it doesn't actually look to me any
different.

55
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,410
Maybe the metal look and feel is the
default.

56
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:50,010
Let's try a different one.

57
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:55,140
So let's try this moti, motif look and
feel or however you pronounce it.

58
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,180
And this is gonna look rubbish again but
in a moment,

59
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,860
I am gonna show you one that's gonna look
really good.

60
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:03,380
So, all set, I run now.

61
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:08,270
And so this looks like something that's
running on motif

62
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:11,910
I guess but I don't want it to look like
that.

63
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:15,990
So let's, if, if you look here in the
sidebar,

64
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:19,830
I think here, there's something about the
members look and feel.

65
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:21,610
Here we go, members look and feel.

66
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:24,740
Which is actually pretty nice, if you look
at that, it's really not bad.

67
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:28,920
so, I'm gonna set that, I'm gonna use this
example code.

68
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,470
Like you see here.

69
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:34,729
Which actually iterates through the
different installed looks and

70
00:04:34,729 --> 00:04:37,920
feels, so you can print them out if you
want.

71
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,302
And if it finds the Nimbus one, it

72
00:04:40,302 --> 00:04:43,970
sets set, then it just throws an exception
there.

73
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:44,830
So let's try that.

74
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:47,960
I'll paste this in here.

75
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:56,950
And I will just say here again, sys out,
cont, set look and feel.

76
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,270
So what we're doing here is, this is just
using ui manager.

77
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:06,810
Don't get ensnared, looks and feels, looks
and feels.

78
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:10,590
Iterating through them and for each look
and feel here, it gets the

79
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:14,540
name and you could display that if you
want to see what's installed.

80
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:20,770
And if one of them contains the letters
Nimbus, it does seven can feel, why it

81
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:22,510
doesn't set the numbers directly just with
the

82
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:24,900
class name, which you could do, I don't
know.

83
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:28,970
Maybe the size class differs in different
releases of Java.

84
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:29,490
I'm not sure.

85
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,850
Anyway, let's try this.

86
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:36,710
So I'll run that and here we got the
nimbus looking field.

87
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:41,910
One thing to be aware of is that because
things will now take up slightly different

88
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:45,340
amounts of space possibly, you may
introduce little

89
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:47,940
bugs in to your application like this one.

90
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:52,550
And what's happened here is that this
preferences dialog is

91
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:57,490
just not wide enough to support the extra
sort of padding.

92
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:01,642
With the nimbus and nimbus look and feel.

93
00:06:01,642 --> 00:06:05,780
So if I find where I set the size on my
dialog

94
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:09,610
here, I maybe just need to set it a little
bit wider.

95
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:10,180
That's 20, 20.

96
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:13,950
This is my preferences dialog code.

97
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:16,690
And Window Preferences.

98
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:18,090
And it's still not good.

99
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:19,210
Let's try 380.

100
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:20,770
And if this

101
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:26,250
doesn't work, actually, I just fix this on
my own time.

102
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,360
But what I wanted to show you-

103
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,660
Yeah, so we're widening this but there's
clearly

104
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:36,080
something else that I've got to fix here.

105
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,100
In fact I will fix it.

106
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,600
I'll go away, fix it, and come back in
just a second.

107
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,540
Hi there, I'm back again, and in fact what
I had to do was not animate the title of.

108
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:52,880
A bit wider, but also set the fill, the
grid by constraints fill.

109
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,700
And to horizontal, for just for the text
fields.

110
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:01,520
So you see that set in the looking field
is not without hazard, but

111
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:06,530
it probably is really worth it, if you
want your application to look nice.

112
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:08,890
And who doesn't?

113
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:13,670
Okay, so that's it for this tutorial, and
If there's anything else

114
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:17,480
that you want to know feel free to drop me
a line.

115
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:21,930
Although, I can't absolutely promise to
answer but I'll try.

116
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:23,990
And check out my other courses on New
Demi.

117
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:28,590
I've got my other course coming up on
Android very soon and there's

118
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:33,130
also a course on web programming and Java
and lots of great stuff.

119
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:36,450
So that's it for now and until next time,
happy coding!
