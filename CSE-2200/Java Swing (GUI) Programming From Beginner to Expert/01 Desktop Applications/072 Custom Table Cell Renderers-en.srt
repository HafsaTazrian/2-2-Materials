00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:05,110
Hello, this is John from
caveofprogramming.com, and in

2
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:09,130
this tutorial we're gonna look at table
cell renderers.

3
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:13,760
So there are basically two work, two ways
to set your own completely custom

4
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:19,035
renderer on a table cell, and one way is
to say

5
00:00:19,035 --> 00:00:24,190
table.get column and then you can get a
column from

6
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:29,180
the table by supplying a a integer.

7
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:36,060
So like get column zero, will get me the
first column in the table.

8
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,340
And then you can say set cell renderer.

9
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:43,060
And that would set a renderer just for
that table column.

10
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:44,900
But I'm not gonna do that here.

11
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:49,790
What I'm gonna do here is, I'm going to
set a renderer

12
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:55,480
for a particular class of object that I've
added to the table.

13
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:59,000
So I'm going to say table.set
defaultRenderer.

14
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:03,690
And here I'm going to supply a class.

15
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:09,470
And I'm going to supply the class of the
employment category.

16
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:12,390
So I'll say employmentCategory.class.

17
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:18,310
And employmentCategory is an enumeration,
you may remember from a previous tutorial

18
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:24,470
that is, it's one of the, data kind of
objects in my table.

19
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:26,990
And at the moment I'm just displaying it
as a string.

20
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:31,744
But, here I'm gonna set a new renderer for
it using a combo box.

21
00:01:31,744 --> 00:01:34,614
And now here I can supply a renderer,

22
00:01:34,614 --> 00:01:40,164
which has to implement the table cell
renderer interface.

23
00:01:40,164 --> 00:01:46,069
so, I'm going to say here

24
00:01:46,069 --> 00:01:52,812
EmploymentCategoryRenderer.

25
00:01:52,812 --> 00:01:57,770
In fact, I'm going to say new
EmploymentCategoryRenderer.

26
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:00,500
And this renderer, I'm going to create
now, so let's just put a

27
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:07,470
semi colon at the end of that line, and
let's go to new class.

28
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:10,810
Actually, I'll put this in the GUI
package,

29
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:13,010
and I'll right click and go to new class.

30
00:02:14,535 --> 00:02:17,690
Employment word category renderer, click
Finish.

31
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:24,340
And let's just say that, that implements
TableCellRenderer, render, renderer.

32
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:31,620
At the import there and next let's add
the, the missing fields.

33
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:36,428
So it just gone one method command here.

34
00:02:36,428 --> 00:02:39,230
And now to actually make the table use
this.

35
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:42,720
I need to go to my table model which is
here.

36
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,970
And in this get common class method that
we've overwritten.

37
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:52,290
And previously I returned Boolean which
causes the chat box to display at one

38
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:58,100
point in the table for the is US citizen
column.

39
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,640
And rest of them are all strings apart
from the first one.

40
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,250
The ID which is an integer it just causes
a different alignment in the table.

41
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:08,020
But I'm gonna go to I think it's column
four here.

42
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:11,490
Cuz in column four we are, we actually

43
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:16,740
got less employment category enumeration
objects in there.

44
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:22,380
And I want to set a renderer for that
particular class.

45
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:25,060
So I need to go to get column class.

46
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:28,811
And instead of returning a string, I want
to say that

47
00:03:28,811 --> 00:03:33,415
what's in that particular column of the
table what's in column

48
00:03:33,415 --> 00:03:38,019
four, actually the fifth column because it
numbers from zero is

49
00:03:38,019 --> 00:03:43,410
going to be employment, is going to be an
EmploymentCategory type.

50
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:44,780
Thing type object.

51
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,960
And when we're actually returning the
values from

52
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:52,280
the table, you might remember in, where
are we?

53
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:58,330
So we've got this, we've got this
somewhere, a method

54
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:03,950
that returns the value for the for the
column.

55
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:10,720
And see, so, we've got value out, get row
count, get column count, get column class.

56
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:13,290
And we've got,

57
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,990
Where, actually, is it?

58
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:19,280
I think I lost it.

59
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,940
Oh yeah, get value at.

60
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:24,240
Yes, so get value at, is, you might
recall,

61
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,510
is, is actually returning the values from
my personal objects

62
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:32,410
from my database and getValueat is
returning an employment category

63
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:36,816
type object, and that's the senior
[UNKNOWN] I've created here.

64
00:04:36,816 --> 00:04:41,140
And we're gonna set a renderer for this in
employment category type.

65
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:44,640
Now the first thing to fix, is so I've got
my renderer there.

66
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,690
I'm gonna have to fix this up.

67
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:52,570
But, actually I probably wanna give these
prettier names

68
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:56,520
because these are just kind of constant
type values.

69
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:00,130
Like, I'd like self employed to have a
space in it, and a lowercase e.

70
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:02,470
But I'm gonna, actually I'll fix that up

71
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:04,890
in a minute, because let's just do this
first.

72
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:08,130
And, and we can actually run the
application.

73
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:14,220
So I've got my table cell renderer, and
I've set, in, of, I've done set, I've done

74
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:20,360
set before renderer for this particular
class, and in my rendeerr, I'm going to

75
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:26,630
actually have a public, private, J combo
box, combo.

76
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:32,340
And, at the import there, and in a
construct

77
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:35,110
here, I'm going to give it constructor,
employment category, renderer.

78
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:40,580
And there, I'm just going to add the
values

79
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:44,780
of, from the employment categories
enumerations to my combo box,

80
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:47,720
and of course, if you weren't working with
enumeration,

81
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,850
you can add whatever you like to that
combo box.

82
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:56,260
But, I'm going to say combo equals new J
combo box.

83
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:59,000
And the simplest way to get values into a
combo box

84
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,230
is just to supply them to the constructor
as an array.

85
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:09,350
And to get the possible values here of my,
employment category as an array,

86
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:18,370
I can say, employmentcategory,Values
there.

87
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:20,850
And that will return the different
possible

88
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:23,020
values for employment category as an
array.

89
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:27,760
And now all those, all I really have to do
is.

90
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:33,533
I need to return the combo in my sort, get
[UNKNOWN] component.

91
00:06:33,533 --> 00:06:35,350
And let's just hover the mouse over that

92
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:37,920
press F2 to get focused on this help
window.

93
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:45,880
And I'm just gonna copy this this list of
parameters from the help Ctrl + C.

94
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:49,100
Because it looks nicer than this aug zero
aug one.

95
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,500
And so on the eclipse is filled in.

96
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:54,230
I'm just gonna paste that node Ctrl+V and
do Ctrl+Shift+F to format.

97
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:59,940
And now, value will be the actually
numeration

98
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:04,380
value that's in this particular cell of
the table.

99
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:08,687
So I wanna say combo.set selected item and
supply the

100
00:07:08,687 --> 00:07:13,290
value there to actually set the right
thing in the combo.

101
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:17,230
And now if I run that hopefully this will
work.

102
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:20,020
Okay so it does work, but you can see that
the the

103
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:24,400
combo is very, the height of it is is not
really enough.

104
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,090
So I'm going to go to my table panel where
I create a table.

105
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:32,110
And I'm going to say table.set row height.

106
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:32,750
Let's set that.

107
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:36,440
Let's try 20 for the row height and see
how that looks.

108
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:41,750
So if I run that and, I think that looks
quite a lot better, may be even 25.

109
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:46,020
Let's try 25 and run that.

110
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,970
And, so now the final touch I can do here
is to get my

111
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,860
numeration to return, to have a two

112
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:56,860
string method that supplies nice looking
values here.

113
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,380
And by the way you'll notice that this

114
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,840
combo box doesn't do anything at the
moment.

115
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,790
And that's just cause I'm, I'm sending a
render at the moment.

116
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:05,800
And then in the next tutorial we'll set
the

117
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,120
editor to make this combo up, combo box
actually function.

118
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,160
But in this tutorial it's just all about
displaying it.

119
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:15,470
And you can display it any how you

120
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:18,800
like, of course, by returning some
component that,

121
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,620
you know, you could have your own
component,

122
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,950
draws its own stuff, and looks really
funky.

123
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,050
It wouldn't like it.

124
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:26,110
But I'm just going to use a combo box for
simplicity.

125
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:31,850
So in Employment category here, this is an
enumeration and

126
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:36,010
objects of this enumeration type are
actually in my table.

127
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:39,560
I'm going to give this to constructor, so
I'll put a semicolon after the

128
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:43,100
last enumeration value and say private,
because

129
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:46,440
the constructors of enumerations have to
be private.

130
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:57,840
And I'll say, I'll get that stringText and
I'll also have a private string text here.

131
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,080
Private instance variable.

132
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:04,100
And in the constructor I'll say this .text
equals text.

133
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,040
And for the two string method, if I right

134
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:10,820
click and go to, source over items in that
methods.

135
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,790
Just got a two string here.

136
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:17,020
And there I'm just gonna return text,
return text.

137
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:19,350
And the place to supply the text here is,

138
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,930
right here where you create your actual
enumeration constants.

139
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:26,610
So I'm gonna say here employed and let's
just copy that.

140
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:33,422
And Ctrl+C and paste it in here, here, and
here.

141
00:09:33,422 --> 00:09:40,550
And so I'm going to have self-employed
with space, unemployed, and other.

142
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:46,809
And now if I run that, you see the thing
is that in my renderer here, I'm supplying

143
00:09:46,809 --> 00:09:52,730
employment category enumeration constants
to my [UNKNOWN], to my combo box.

144
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:56,320
And the combo box will call just call

145
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,420
two string on the objects to actually
display them.

146
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,960
