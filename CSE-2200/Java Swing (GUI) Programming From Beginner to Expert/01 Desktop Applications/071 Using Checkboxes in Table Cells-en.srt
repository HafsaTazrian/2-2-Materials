00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:02,510
Hello.

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:08,850
In this tutorial we're gonna have a look
at using check boxes in tables.

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:12,930
And to use a check box in a table is
actually pretty simple

4
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:14,990
but it's gonna introduce another little

5
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:18,600
concept that's useful to know about
tables.

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:24,320
At the same time, so at the moment in this

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:30,540
table we've got a U.S. citizen, which is a
column, which is either true or false and

8
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:33,700
I'm gonna change that to use a check box,
so obviously you can

9
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,780
tick it, if it's true and it's gonna be
not ticked, if it's false.

10
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:46,930
Now to do that let's go to the table model
and actually it's in GUI.

11
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:53,780
So we've got this person, table model.

12
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:56,880
Which is in the GUI package cuz it's a
kind of a

13
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,890
model for GUI component, rather than the
data, proper data model and such.

14
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:06,510
And we've got, let's maximize the editor
here.

15
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:08,513
We've got this column at the end,

16
00:01:08,513 --> 00:01:12,490
U.S. citizen and that's, that's column
let's see.

17
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:17,440
So, looking at previous code we've written
here, that's column number 5.

18
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:23,200
Now what I need to do is, there's going to
be a couple of things here.

19
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:29,450
But firstly I need to right click here and
go to Source > Override Implement Methods

20
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:35,270
and there is this getCommonClass method
here, so I'm gonna override that.

21
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:40,070
And so we're overriding a method of the
abstract table

22
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:45,032
model here, and all table models have to
have this method.

23
00:01:45,032 --> 00:01:51,030
And getCommonClass has this funny return
type class brackets question mark.

24
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:53,690
And that's saying basically we need to
return

25
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:59,580
a class an object of type class and class

26
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,430
is a template class, it gets awfully
confusing

27
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,440
but this is simpler than it looks once you

28
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,440
see how it actually works and I'm going

29
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,510
to put in here, this is actually, this
argument's

30
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:16,280
actually column and I'm going to do switch
on column and we're going to have a bunch

31
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,430
of cases here and actually.

32
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:21,910
This is gonna be pretty similar to this
switch, you can get the value of that.

33
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:24,870
So I'm just gonna use that, let's copy
that.

34
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:29,090
And paste it in up here and I can use this
as a guide.

35
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:33,949
Now, okay so the first column, column
zero.

36
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:38,100
Well, yes, I'm gonna return to class for
each of these columns and that

37
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:45,440
is gonna actually cause the is U.S.
citizen to render as a check box.

38
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,658
And if we return boolean for this class,
it's

39
00:02:48,658 --> 00:02:52,930
gonna, it's gonna render this check box in
a table.

40
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:56,140
And a table renders a bunch of default
types in different ways and

41
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,335
the main ones have string in it,

42
00:02:57,335 --> 00:03:01,640
string numerical values which is aligned
differently.

43
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,760
And then these boolean values have a check
box.

44
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,536
So let's just have a look at how that
works.

45
00:03:06,536 --> 00:03:09,952
So for get idea, I'm gonna return integer.

46
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:11,312
[SOUND].

47
00:03:11,312 --> 00:03:13,039
And, well that's my window closing.

48
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:16,072
I thought it was a gun going off for a
minute, but luckily it wasn't.

49
00:03:16,072 --> 00:03:20,671
Okay, and for name I need to return
String.class

50
00:03:20,671 --> 00:03:26,130
and this .class just returns an object of
type class.

51
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:33,670
Class is confusingly a class in Java and
yeah, get occupation.

52
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:37,470
I, again, I'm just gonna return string for
moment for most of these.

53
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:40,370
So a little later I'm going to look at how
you can

54
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:45,502
put combo boxes in tables and then we'll
return something other than string.

55
00:03:45,502 --> 00:03:46,873
So string there.

56
00:03:46,873 --> 00:03:48,670
And string and taxID.

57
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:50,590
Let's see taxID.

58
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:55,160
GetTaxID is returning what?

59
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,610
It's returning, hover my mouse so it
returning strings.

60
00:03:58,610 --> 00:03:59,918
So let's make that a string as well.

61
00:03:59,918 --> 00:04:03,560
So return String.class and here's the

62
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,150
bit that's particularly relevant to this
tutorial.

63
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:11,999
For each U.S citizen I'm gonna say return
Boolean, capital B .class,

64
00:04:11,999 --> 00:04:18,700
like that and if you return a, yeah I need
target default value there.

65
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,499
Although it shouldn't be anymore cons.

66
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:25,690
This, this collection never be more than
six but Java's

67
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:28,030
gonna say you know, what if it is more
than six?

68
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,840
You gotta return to something.

69
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,650
So then I'll just return null.

70
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:33,740
I think that will work.

71
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,470
Yeah return null.

72
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:41,720
Now okay, let's run that and now we can
see already that we've got the this

73
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:48,790
boolean column which we return
Boolean.class is rendering as a checkbox.

74
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:51,710
But we can't actually tick it or untick
it.

75
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:58,655
To make it editable, we've got to go to is
setEditable

76
00:04:58,655 --> 00:05:06,020
and say case 5 return true, that's for
column 5 you want it to be editable.

77
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:12,097
We also need to store the values, so I am
going to say here in setValue at

78
00:05:12,097 --> 00:05:19,060
case 5 person.setUSCitizens

79
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:22,540
and that's gonna be now boolean value.

80
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:26,080
So we're gonna cast the value that were
passed in here

81
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,980
to a boolean cuz that's what it's gonna
be, basically boolean.

82
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:31,550
There we go.

83
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:32,570
That'll do that trick.

84
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:38,820
If I run that now, we've got, let's take
Sue and say Sue's your citizen.

85
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:42,490
And just to prove it works, I just reload
the data.

86
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:45,640
It didn't seem to work actually.

87
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,250
Let's take that.

88
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,220
Oh yeah, I forgot to save it.

89
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:50,560
Save the data, then refresh.

90
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,540
And we can see that the check has remained
checked.

91
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,550
And I'll run it again and just-

92
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:57,050
There you go.

93
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:59,330
You can see it still ticked there.

94
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:02,450
So, pretty minimal work to get a check box
in your table.

95
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:05,950
You just need to return the boolean value
for that column.

96
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:09,540
Boolean.class must be returned and get
column class.

97
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,980
And you've gotta insert editable.

98
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:16,564
You need to, is that, sorry,
isCellEditable

99
00:06:16,564 --> 00:06:20,400
you gotta return true for that column.

100
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,560
And finally you probably want to provide a
set value at method.

101
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:30,470
A set value at code, some code for set
value at for that

102
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:34,500
column so that you can literally set the
value in your date model [UNKNOWN].

103
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:39,610
That's all for this tutorial and join me
again next time.

104
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:41,500
And until then happy coding.
