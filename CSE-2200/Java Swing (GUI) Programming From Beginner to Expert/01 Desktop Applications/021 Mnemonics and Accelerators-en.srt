00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:02,490
Hello.

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:03,160
Welcome back.

3
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:06,738
This is John from caveofprogramming.com.

4
00:00:06,738 --> 00:00:12,168
And in this tutorial, we're gonna look at
Mnemonics and Accelerators.

5
00:00:12,168 --> 00:00:18,450
So I've got this application here and I
have a menu here.

6
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:23,760
And we're gonna add some Mnemonics and
Accelerators to this menu for a start.

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,538
So Mnemonics is actually it's a key that
you press together

8
00:00:29,538 --> 00:00:35,252
with the Alt key that invokes a component
that's already visible.

9
00:00:35,252 --> 00:00:42,480
So if I want to get to the Exit menu here,
the exit, Exit menu item.

10
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,990
Via Mnemonic.

11
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:48,220
I first got to invoke the File menu, cuz
the File menu is visible.

12
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:50,750
So I can use the mnemonic on that.

13
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:54,700
Then I can use the mnemonic on the Exist
menu, when that's visible.

14
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,610
And mnemonics is kind of an accessibility
feature.

15
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:03,720
And they're also used by many of us just
as a keyboard shortcut.

16
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:08,500
For expert users, there are also
accelerators and accelerators

17
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:13,020
work certainly at least on menus even if
they're not

18
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,370
visible and you can set mnemonics on other
controls

19
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:21,620
besides menus but accelerators I think are
just for menus.

20
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:25,670
So we're gonna take a look at examples of
both here and

21
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:29,714
I'm gonna start by making this File > Exit
menu actually do something.

22
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,270
So here I am in my main frame where I
create the menu.

23
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:40,700
I've got this create menu bar method here
in.

24
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:41,730
In the main frame.

25
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,700
And I'm gonna add an x, a mnemonics to the
File menu.

26
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,012
So we'll say filemenu.

27
00:01:52,012 --> 00:01:54,865
setmneumonic, setmneumonic.

28
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:58,930
And there is a version that takes a char
but that's considered obsolete.

29
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:01,048
So you should use the int fashion.

30
00:02:01,048 --> 00:02:04,560
And the int that you passed to it is
static

31
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:10,640
constant from the key event class and, and
there are static

32
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,720
const, constants representing all the keys
on your keyboard, so

33
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:19,580
I'll do Ctrl+Shift+O and I will to add the
import there.

34
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:20,620
Doesn't seem to have worked.

35
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:28,710
I want to add VK F, which is stands for
virtual key F.

36
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,680
I'm not sure why I can't add my key event.

37
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,300
Oh, there we go.

38
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,790
Now it's working.

39
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:41,910
So if I now run my application, you can
see that the

40
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:48,420
F of File menu is underlined, telling me
that the mnemonic is Alt+F.

41
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,530
So if I hold down Alt now, and press F.

42
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:55,570
It opens the File menu and I can actually
scroll through that with the arrow keys.

43
00:02:55,570 --> 00:03:00,000
Let's also add a mnemonic on the Exit menu
item.

44
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,226
So I can say exitItem.setMnemonic and for
exit

45
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:10,808
the most traditional mnemonic is probably
the

46
00:03:10,808 --> 00:03:16,180
the X key, so let's add in
KeyEvent.virtual key X.

47
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:25,330
And so if I run that now I can do, if I do
Alt+X now I'm hitting Alt+X does nothing.

48
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:31,280
If I do Alt+F, and then we see the X of
Exit is underlined.

49
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,810
And if I hit now Alt+X, then it invokes my
Exit menu item.

50
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:39,400
And let's actually make that work, to make
this more interesting.

51
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:46,584
So exitItem.addActionListener
addActionListener new ActionListener.

52
00:03:46,584 --> 00:03:51,131
Put the brackets in there, and then add
the

53
00:03:51,131 --> 00:03:56,689
actionPerformed method and let's get rid
of some of

54
00:03:56,689 --> 00:04:02,375
these extra lines that I don't need and
put semicolon

55
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:07,860
in, and then here I would just do System
system.

56
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:08,410
I accept.

57
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:10,940
So I always, I always feel that there
should

58
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:13,550
be some more adequate way of exiting from
Swing programs.

59
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:15,760
But as far as I know, this is the right
way to do it.

60
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,700
And later on where we are probably gonna
look at well

61
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,980
we are gonna look at adding a confirmation
for the exit here.

62
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:23,660
So if I run that.

63
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:28,870
Now if I do Alt+F+X then the application
exits.

64
00:04:31,006 --> 00:04:37,739
You can also add mnemonics to to like form
items so you can add for example

65
00:04:37,739 --> 00:04:43,800
let's take the OK button as an example
search for J button here.

66
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:49,720
So underneath where I create the OK button
I could do in

67
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,390
fact, what I'll do here, cuz this is a bit
mixed up,

68
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:58,530
I will delete the OK button, mind creation
from here, and I'll

69
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:03,340
put it up here, where I'm creating the
other controls just for consistency.

70
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:08,490
And I can have a comment here saying Set
up op mnemonics, mnemonics.

71
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:10,650
I think that's spelled right.

72
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:19,960
And I'm gonna say OK button dot set set
mnemonic, I think it is set mnemonic.

73
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:27,280
And, KeyEvent.VK

74
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,100
and let's make it, I don't know, vko for
OK.

75
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:36,610
So that's inside the import there and if I
run

76
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:41,030
that now, you see the o is underlined of
OK.

77
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:46,250
And if I do Alt+O, then it clicks OK for
me, which is rather nice.

78
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:54,870
I can now fall text fields and these other
controls here,

79
00:05:54,870 --> 00:06:01,270
like for example, if I look at let's look
at and combo.

80
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:09,540
So, end combo, endCombo has no set
mneumonic and the

81
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:12,050
reason for that is, for these other kinds
of control.

82
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:15,390
You don't set a mnemonic on a Control
itself.

83
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:23,180
You set it on an associated label, and you
see here that otherwise you might want

84
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:28,640
to line the mnemonic if it's in a text
field, there's no text in here.

85
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,200
The text is on this label.

86
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:38,216
And in fact you set the mnemonic on the
label, so the way that works

87
00:06:38,216 --> 00:06:45,567
is I can say, for example, name
nameLabel.setmneumonic.

88
00:06:45,567 --> 00:06:49,657
SetDisplayed mneumonic, actually.

89
00:06:49,657 --> 00:06:51,660
Displayed Displayed mneumonic.

90
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:52,367
There we go.

91
00:06:52,367 --> 00:06:53,250
And key events.

92
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:57,310
And this is a name [INAUDIBLE].

93
00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:00,620
If I run that, you can see let's underline
the.

94
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:04,060
And in the name as you might expect.

95
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:08,060
And now what I need to do is I need to say
nameLabel, nameLabel.

96
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:13,970
And because we need to tell the label what
what

97
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:17,980
to set the label for so you say
setLabelFor and.

98
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:25,895
Pass in the nameField there and if I now
run this and I do Alt+N then

99
00:07:25,895 --> 00:07:31,890
it sets the focus in my name field and I
can do Alt+O to submit that information.

100
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:36,430
So, one last thing for this tutorial,
Which is

101
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:42,830
we're gonna look at, accelerators which
just apply to menus.

102
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:45,080
So, as far as I know.

103
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:50,600
So let's go back to the main frame again
and an accelerator

104
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,860
is a key like I don't have any examples
here in eclipse.

105
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:59,250
yeah, so like Ctrl+W here is an
accelerator.

106
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:05,010
And you can invoke accelerators without
the menu actually displaying

107
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:12,320
so, let's add A accelerator Ctrl+X rather
than Alt+X to the Exit menu item.

108
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:19,600
And the way to do that is, is say
exitItem.setAccelerator

109
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:24,490
and then that accepts the Keystroke object

110
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:27,608
and I actually use the static method to
the keystroke class called.

111
00:08:27,608 --> 00:08:33,270
Get key 'kay, looks like the input there.

112
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:34,380
And getKeyStroke.

113
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:39,310
And the, the method I want takes two
parameters, and the

114
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:43,095
first parameter is a key event, it's a
Virtual key code.

115
00:08:43,095 --> 00:08:47,890
VK_X, is what I'll use in this case for
the X key.

116
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:49,970
And then you need.

117
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:55,853
A a method of, sorry a static constant of
the ActionEventClass,

118
00:08:55,853 --> 00:09:00,664
rather strangely, and I want to use in
this case, a CTRL_MASK

119
00:09:00,664 --> 00:09:05,870
constant, so you can see the accelerator,
unlike the mnemonic, the mnemonic

120
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:09,790
is made for one key, the accelerator's
made for two keys because.

121
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:13,150
The mnemonic is always Alt, but
accelerated you can choose

122
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:17,150
your key so I'm choosing CTRL_MASK with
the X key.

123
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:23,990
And if I now run that, if I look at the
menu I'll use my, my, mnemonic actually.

124
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:26,700
You can see that it's not only is it
outlining the x

125
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,320
of x out, which's the mnemonic, but it's
put Ctrl+X in here.

126
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,280
Which is the accelerator.

127
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:37,420
Let's get rid of the menu and if I do
Ctrl+X, it now quits my application.

128
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,530
Ctrl+X, there we go.

129
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:44,630
So accelerators are for expert uses and
you can gradually learn tha, the

130
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:50,270
accelerators of an application, and invoke
them without actually opening the menu.

131
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:53,970
So that's enough for this tutorial.

132
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,740
And in the next tutorial, we're gonna look
at option panes and I'm gonna

133
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:06,500
show you how to add a confirmation here to
this Exit menu item.

134
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:11,660
So, join me again then and until next
time, happy programming.
