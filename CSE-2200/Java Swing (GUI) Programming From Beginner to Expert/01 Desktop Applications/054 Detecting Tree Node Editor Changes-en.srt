00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:05,260
Hello this is John from
caveofprogramming.com.

2
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:08,570
And in this tutorial we're gonna look at a
simple way

3
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:14,810
to retrieve data from your, from the
editors in your tree leaves.

4
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:18,873
So in the last tutorial we got this tree
working.

5
00:00:18,873 --> 00:00:21,628
And it's got these editors that you can,
it's got these

6
00:00:21,628 --> 00:00:24,489
check boxes in the leaves that you can
tick on and off.

7
00:00:24,489 --> 00:00:26,816
In this tutorial we're just gonna look at

8
00:00:26,816 --> 00:00:30,140
how you can get the data from these
editors.

9
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:36,475
And what I'm gonna do is, I've, I've
actually, since the last tutorial.

10
00:00:36,475 --> 00:00:42,030
I've taken server info object and I've put
it into it's own class, because it's

11
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:45,660
used on the message panel to serve the
tree cell editor, and the tree cell

12
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:50,820
renderor, so because it's used by three
classes it makes no sense to dump it in

13
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:56,260
with this message panel class, so I've
moved that and I'm now gonna go.

14
00:00:56,260 --> 00:01:01,090
Get rid of this tree selection listener
because the tree

15
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:04,120
selection listener will tell you if a node
has been

16
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:08,720
selected on the tree, but that's selected
in the sense

17
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,750
of basically being clicked on so that it
has the focus.

18
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:16,560
So that's now selected, and I don, I don't
care whether it's selected

19
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,020
or not, what I care about is whether it's
checked on the roster now.

20
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:25,890
And I only care about the leaves here,
because I don't have to have a check boxes

21
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:30,970
in, so I'm going to get rid of that and,
and I'm

22
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:36,240
actually gonna listen to a to events

23
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:41,190
on the editor because in servertry editor,
the

24
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:46,210
class I implemented in the last tutorial,
we when a

25
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:52,140
check box is being ticked or unticked, we
call fire editing stopped and that's

26
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:57,133
the event that we're gonna look for now in
message panel, because I'm gonna say.

27
00:01:57,133 --> 00:02:03,690
Treecelleditor.addcelleditorlistener,

28
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:08,239
this map, and I'll add a new cell editor
listener there.

29
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:12,520
And put semicolon in here.

30
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:17,280
And add the unimplemented method there.

31
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,060
I'm not interested in the editing canceled
here so I'll just delete that.

32
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:25,830
But I am interested in editing stopped
here.

33
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:30,860
So that's, put a let's put, let's put this
out

34
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:34,630
in there if I can find it again, here we
go.

35
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,600
So, in here I'm gonna put this out just
for the moment, hello.

36
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:49,740
Now if I run my tree and nothing happens
when I click on the upper branches here.

37
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:54,380
And if I click on the check box then it
fires that event.

38
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:59,441
So it's saying hello there, [SOUND] which
is exactly what I want.

39
00:02:59,441 --> 00:03:05,309
And what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
actually use the retrieve

40
00:03:05,309 --> 00:03:11,079
cell editor method that I implemented in
the last tutorial, so again

41
00:03:11,079 --> 00:03:17,070
this get cell editor value method, and
that's the one I'm gonna use.

42
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:21,100
I'm gonna see tree select editor.get cell
editor value.

43
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,980
And, that is a server info object, so I'll
say

44
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:32,600
server info, info equals cast that to the
server info.

45
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,140
Cuz it returns the object.

46
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,350
And that's how this is word solved here.

47
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:40,790
And let's say info, which is it gonna call
it two string method.

48
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:47,330
And let's say let's say, let's have the ID
as well.

49
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:48,864
So info.getid.

50
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:55,535
And, let's then have,

51
00:03:55,535 --> 00:04:01,575
an info.isChecked.

52
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:04,019
And [INAUDIBLE] plus there.

53
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:13,230
So now if I run this I can click on
messages and click, I untick New York.

54
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:16,230
It's gonna say New York, zero, which is
the idea of New York.

55
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:18,480
It's the first one, false.

56
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,678
If it's ticked it's true.

57
00:04:20,678 --> 00:04:23,325
Try Edinburgh, which is four.

58
00:04:23,325 --> 00:04:29,212
[SOUND] false true and see if it works
pretty damn well.

59
00:04:29,212 --> 00:04:34,767
So, in the next tutorial, I'm gonna build
a data structure that's gonna

60
00:04:34,767 --> 00:04:40,144
be, kind of a star simulated message
server, and we're gonna have

61
00:04:40,144 --> 00:04:45,810
something where you can retrieve,
supposedly, messages from a server.

62
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:51,730
For using the ID's of just those servers

63
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:56,040
that we have checked in the tree and
ultimately were gonna fix

64
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:01,041
this application up, so that when you
check, check

65
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:06,730
,a check box or un-check a check box
you'll see a progress bar you

66
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:09,120
know say like getting messages or
something

67
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,790
and then we'll have a [INAUDIBLE] down
here,

68
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:13,960
where you can see the titles of the
messages, and then where you

69
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,380
can read the messages, and you wouldn't
necessarily want to do that in a

70
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:22,350
real application but I just wanna show you
something useful here with trees and

71
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:26,150
ultimately with things like threads and
program

72
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:30,280
bars, so I'm just concocting something
here.

73
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,280
I heard that, that's sort of plausible,
and

74
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,300
we're gonna simulate the actual existence
of the message

75
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:38,510
server, rather than actually doing any
socket programming

76
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:40,880
or anything like that, which is a
different topic.

77
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,935
Okay, so join me again next time, and
until next time, happy coding.

78
00:05:44,935 --> 00:05:48,364
[SOUND]
