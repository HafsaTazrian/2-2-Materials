00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:05,450
Hi, this is John from
caveofprogramming.com and in

2
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:09,096
this tutorial we're gonna look at combo
boxes.

3
00:00:09,096 --> 00:00:16,450
Combo boxes are sort of like combination
of a text field and a list box.

4
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:20,080
Where you have like a kind of drop down
thing at the side of the box.

5
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:26,520
And they work pretty much like, list
boxes, Excel, that you can

6
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,990
make them editable which allows users to
enter their own values in them.

7
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:34,540
So if you want to go in and try that for
yourself then be my guest.

8
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:38,300
And if you want to see a worked example of
this then stick around.

9
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:45,990
So, if I run this, this is the application
I created in the last tutorial unto now.

10
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:52,620
And I'm gonna add a combo box in here
under the list box.

11
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:56,910
So I'm gonna go to my form panel class
here,

12
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:03,270
and I'm gonna start by creating a private
variable JComboBox.

13
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:09,760
And I'm gonna make this a list of
Employment

14
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,594
types, so I'll call that emp, emp combo

15
00:01:14,594 --> 00:01:20,010
maybe empCombo, employment combo that
should do the trick.

16
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:28,840
And I'll just add the input there and
where I'm creating my components here.

17
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:37,770
I'll say empCombo equals JCombobox.

18
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:41,722
And then in the same way that here I
created a default list model

19
00:01:41,722 --> 00:01:46,450
for my combo box, so let's just put a
comment, Set up list box.

20
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:47,920
Now I want to.

21
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,880
Set up my combo box in SMOA so, Set up
combo

22
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:59,026
box, so I'm going to create a default
combo box model,

23
00:01:59,026 --> 00:02:04,670
call that emp model equals

24
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:10,646
new default combo box model and I'm gonna
add some items to that.

25
00:02:10,646 --> 00:02:17,218
And model.addElement and
@model.addElement, this is just

26
00:02:17,218 --> 00:02:20,630
the same as the list case really.

27
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:24,020
I'm gonna have some strings in here, lets
say employed

28
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:28,989
and I'm just gonna Copy that.

29
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:34,030
And Paste in a couple more.

30
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:38,980
And let's have self-employed and
unemployed.

31
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:44,143
And then, I'm gonna set that model on

32
00:02:44,143 --> 00:02:50,330
the combo box, so empCombo.setModel, set
model, empModel.

33
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:55,240
Now I can already add that combo box to my

34
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:59,330
layout but this layout is actually getting
a bit complex, if

35
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:03,120
we look at the class here, it's getting
quite big and

36
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,270
there's a hell of a lot of stuff in one
method.

37
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:08,710
So, just to make it a little bit more
readable.

38
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:15,615
What I'm gonna do is, I am gonna add to
the method here, public void

39
00:03:15,615 --> 00:03:22,070
layoutComponents.

40
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:25,130
And I'm gonna take this layout code here,
that

41
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:28,838
uses a grid like layout, right up to here.

42
00:03:28,838 --> 00:03:33,120
Here do Ctrl+X and I'm gonna paste it in
there, so at

43
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,750
least we got the grid bug layout stuff in
a different method.

44
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:40,300
And here, I can call layoutComponents.

45
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:43,420
So, it's always good to hit the green run
button after you've made any kind

46
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:47,990
of major change, so in a moment, still, it
looks the same it appears to work.

47
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:48,610
So that's good.

48
00:03:49,815 --> 00:03:56,360
And what I'm gonna do now is I want to
make just a little

49
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:02,530
adjustment to this, this layout to make it
a bit easier to add new components.

50
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:04,280
I've broken it down into rows.

51
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,367
And if I want to add a new component now,
I've got

52
00:04:07,367 --> 00:04:10,620
to move this button down a row and then
set one here.

53
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:18,079
So just to make it a little bit easier,
I'm gonna go to the top here and I'll set

54
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:25,260
grid y right at the beginning here and
then when I get to the next row

55
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:31,460
I'm going to take grid y out and put it
here.

56
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:36,560
And just do ++ and this means that I've
got to always do this row by row.

57
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,810
Otherwise it would get horribly tangled.

58
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:42,160
But and you have to kinda do this thing
very judiciously

59
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,890
because you could really mess up your
layout if you're not careful.

60
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:52,110
But I think at this point it's gonna
simplify things a bit if I use-

61
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:57,160
if I increment the row each time instead
of setting the row to an actual number.

62
00:04:58,450 --> 00:04:59,340
So.

63
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:04,860
That's still the finer want here and let's
check that it still looks okay.

64
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:08,140
I haven't messed anything up and another
thing I

65
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,420
want to do actually is add a label on the

66
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,850
left hand side here but I'm gonna do that
in

67
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:15,950
just a second after I add in my combo box.

68
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:19,480
So let's change this from the comment from
fourth row to

69
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:23,420
just next row because these are just gonna
be more rows

70
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:26,360
and then, to add in a new row now, I can

71
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,760
copy this, which is my list box and just
paste it in.

72
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:34,765
And if I've got this right, if I add in
now

73
00:05:34,765 --> 00:05:40,160
empCombo and I run that I'm gonna get my
combo box here.

74
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,590
It's very nice.

75
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:42,970
That said in a label as well.

76
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:50,140
So, my, some of my controls have labels
like, like here.

77
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:56,790
And, and I think, if I copy that.

78
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,670
And I go down here.

79
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,720
So here's my ageList.

80
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,040
And let's go after I've set the weights.

81
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,040
I should be able to just create a new
label here

82
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:10,680
because I don't really have to have the
labels as instanced variables.

83
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,520
I can just use them here because the
labels are probably not gonna change.

84
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:19,750
So I can just create a label on the fly
here and say new JLabel and this should

85
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:26,410
say age, semi, sorry, colon.

86
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:28,700
I forgot what this was called for a
minute.

87
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:31,280
Okay, and if I run that let's take a look
at it and see if it works.

88
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,380
So, we've got age there but I want to
align the age.

89
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:39,050
I want to put it the FIRST_LINE_END so,
rather than line end

90
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:43,980
so the first line int is kinda top, is
kinda top right.

91
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,400
So there we go, that looks pretty good.

92
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:50,820
And I'm gonna use that again for my combo
box so let's

93
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:56,240
paste this in here and this time it's
gonna be new JLabel

94
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:00,838
Employment.

95
00:07:00,838 --> 00:07:08,800
And run that and that looks terrible cuz
it's aligned to the bottom there.

96
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,140
So let's try putting that as well, first.

97
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,140
First line in, see how that looks.

98
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,760
And that's not so bad, I would say.

99
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:22,020
And now, to get the values from this combo
box,

100
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,630
it's pretty much the same as with the list
box.

101
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:31,290
This is very similar, I can do here, let's
say string empCut equals new,

102
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:37,435
actually equals, sorry, String, so a
typecast here and empCombo.

103
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:42,882
And instead of being get selected value,
it's getSelected,

104
00:07:42,882 --> 00:07:48,420
getSelectedItem and also like, if you want
to have multiple

105
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:53,700
selection in there, you can and you can
return the rate of selected objects.

106
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:56,050
So.

107
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:04,779
And actually come to think of it, with
JList you can allow multiple selection, by

108
00:08:04,779 --> 00:08:10,249
doing, age in this case, for example,
ageList.set.

109
00:08:11,552 --> 00:08:16,200
Selection mode and you can, if you look

110
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,430
up the documentation for that you can
allow it

111
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,550
multiple items to be selected but I think
in

112
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:25,050
a combo box you can't actually select
multiple items.

113
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:26,710
I think I'm wrong to say that.

114
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:32,870
But anyway, so we'll get now the, item.

115
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:35,430
So we're, we're getting the item from the
combo box here.

116
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,550
And I'm just gonna output that here.

117
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:40,650
So I'm just gonna output empCat.

118
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:45,700
And if I run that, and now click OK

119
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:52,580
on my console here, I'm gonna see the
combo box, kind of selection.

120
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,560
And of course if I wanted, I could then,
when I set it by combo.

121
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:05,380
I could say and empCombo.setSelectedIndex,
let's set that to zero.

122
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:07,380
So, it has a default selection.

123
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:09,650
There we go.

124
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:15,320
Now you can make your combo box editable.

125
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:24,210
So, I can say empCombo.setEditable, True.

126
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:29,470
And if you do that, it means that so if I
run it now, you can see now it's

127
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:34,750
appearing in white and I can select all
the values that

128
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:40,640
are in it as before, set this to
unemployed, as befits the times.

129
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:46,580
And if I type something in here like I can
say other for example.

130
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:49,750
Then, it will retrieve that value when I
do

131
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,530
get selected item, the thing to watch with
this though,

132
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:57,710
is that with ageList I used an ageCategory
object

133
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:00,590
that I created, and I put that into the
list.

134
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:06,110
And so that I could pair up ID's with,
with the

135
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:10,690
actual items rather than just cut the
string that represents the item.

136
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:13,280
And you can use the same trick with combo
boxes

137
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:16,720
but the problem is that if the user edits
the

138
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,510
box you won't retrieve your, a object of
the type

139
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:24,610
that you put into it, you're retrieve a
string instead.

140
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:26,480
So you have to think about how to deal
with that,.

141
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,410
You could use instance of to check what

142
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:30,670
you're returning from the combo box, for
example.

143
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:35,610
And, or you could just do getSelectedIndex
and just

144
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:37,860
get the index of the things, thing that's
selected.

145
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,310
It doesn't matter too much.

146
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:42,140
Lots of ways to do it.

147
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:47,050
And but for the moment, for this tutorial,
just to keep things a little bit simpler.

148
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:52,050
I'm just gonna use this string straight
from the combo box and I'm gonna go to my

149
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:58,000
event of course and, and let's add in here
a string empCat

150
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,240
and I'll give this also a private string,
empCat and I

151
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,000
just set that, implement category here, so
empCat equals empCat.

152
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,930
This is my event object that kinda relays

153
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:17,330
the information to the main, the main
frame.

154
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:23,594
Let's have a public String
getEmploymentCategory

155
00:11:23,594 --> 00:11:27,730
and just return empCat like that.

156
00:11:28,882 --> 00:11:31,960
And then so all I have to do now is in
here I

157
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:35,495
can pass in, when I create the event I can
pass in my empCat.

158
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,300
And if I save that, the arrow should go
away.

159
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:45,690
And in mainframe now, so when I

160
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:51,304
receive the form event occurred, I could
say string empCat equals

161
00:11:51,304 --> 00:11:56,590
event.getEmploymentCategory.

162
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:59,362
And I can add it in here, so empCat

163
00:11:59,362 --> 00:12:03,620
and plus and let's have some punctuation
as well.

164
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:11,430
And let's run that and let's fill
something in here John

165
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,710
Software.

166
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:19,440
1865 self-employed okay and here we got
all the information.

167
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,710
So that's it for this tutorial.

168
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:29,400
And in the next tutorial, we're gonna look
at checkboxes so join me again then.

169
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,790
And until next time, happy coding.
