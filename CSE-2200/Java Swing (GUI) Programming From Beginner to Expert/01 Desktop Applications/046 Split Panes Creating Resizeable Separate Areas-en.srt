00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:05,990
Hello, this is John from
caveofprogramming.com, and

2
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:09,800
in this tutorial we're gonna look at
JSplitPane.

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:14,200
And so if I, if I run the program as it is
at the moment now, and at the

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:18,000
moment there's a kind of firm fixed size
between

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,490
this table and this form, when you can't
resize it.

6
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:23,970
Which actually really is probably fine for
this application.

7
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:27,710
But, in order to demonstrate SplitPanes,
which are often very useful.

8
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,360
I'm gonna change this so that you can
resize

9
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:36,180
the border between these two these two
forms here.

10
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:41,790
So I'm gonna go to my main frame here, and

11
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:47,660
I'm gonna create a private JSplitPane,
which I'll call Split Pane.

12
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,560
And after I've constructed my other

13
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,951
components down here, I'm gonna say,
SplitPane.

14
00:00:56,510 --> 00:01:00,290
That's actually at the import, so the
auto-complete works.

15
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:05,580
SplitPane, equals new JSplitPane.

16
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,600
And, I'm gonna supply some arguments to
the constructor here.

17
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,720
And the first one is gonna be jsplit,
whoops.

18
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,980
Ctrl+Z.

19
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:20,340
The first one is gonna be jsplitpane, and
here I wanna set where I,

20
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:24,900
I need to set whether I want a horizontal
split or a vertical split.

21
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,330
And in this case, I want my components to
be arranged left and right.

22
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:34,080
So I want the horizontal split and then,
I'm going to pass in the two components.

23
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,700
So I want to split between and you can
change these

24
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,670
components dynamically, if you want to,
but here I won't do that.

25
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:45,240
I'll just say, on the left, and on the
Form Panel,

26
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:50,060
and on the right, I want the Table Panel,
like that.

27
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:56,800
So and now instead of adding the Form
Panel under Table Panel down

28
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:02,370
here, I'm gonna add the split pane, at
borderly at the center, and

29
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:05,490
I'm gonna get rid of this separate from
panel ad, and if I

30
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:10,969
run that now, and I've got the split pane
here, which is, re-sizeable.

31
00:02:10,969 --> 00:02:12,930
[UNKNOWN] There we go.

32
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:16,930
And now there's a few things you can do
with this.

33
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:18,830
One thing is I need to fix a little bug

34
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:22,660
here because the way my application works
at the moment, I

35
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:26,820
can go to window show an unticked person
form, and the

36
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:32,470
person form vanishes, and split pane
handles it rather nicely, actually.

37
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:35,420
If I go show it doesn't reappear.

38
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:38,260
So I'm gonna finally show Menu Item.

39
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,550
I think it's called Show Item.

40
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,700
Or maybe not.

41
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:45,270
Show Menu let's have a look.

42
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,040
Show Menu.

43
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:46,900
So we've got Show Menu.

44
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,890
And we've got Show Format in here.

45
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:55,100
And I've got an action listener, here we
go.

46
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:58,096
So, I'm gonna change this, I'm going to
set

47
00:02:58,096 --> 00:03:03,830
the the size of the divider on the
splitter.

48
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:11,670
I'm gonna set the position of the divider,
sorry, when you show the Form Panel again.

49
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:19,450
So let's say here, if menu item.is
selected.

50
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:24,030
So, in other words, if the menu items
ticked which means that the users ticked

51
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:28,680
it, when it was unticked before, so
they're ticking it to show the Form Panel.

52
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:36,460
I'm gonna say SplitPane.set, divider
location.

53
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:40,480
And you'll notice there's two, there's two
varieties of this.

54
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,540
There's one that takes a double and that's
a

55
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:48,250
proportional location from zero, 0.0 to
one point naught.

56
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:52,640
And there's one that takes an int, which
is a pixel, location.

57
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,730
From the left, in this case.

58
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:57,530
I, I want to set, actually, the

59
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:02,931
location to do something approximately
like the formpanel.,

60
00:04:02,931 --> 00:04:08,070
and let's get the minimum size of the Form
Panel here.

61
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:09,860
And one thing I really need to mention,

62
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:14,390
actually, is that you should set minimum
sizes on

63
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:20,458
your components, so if I go to, let's just
take a quick look in the Form Panel here.

64
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:27,649
Form Panel, here, I got a preferred size,
I've actually got a minimum size.

65
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:32,220
And so the minimum size is probably gonna
be set

66
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:37,350
at the default, when I set the, set the
preferred size.

67
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,140
That's that.

68
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:41,530
A minimum size here, and so that's, when I

69
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:45,666
call set preferred size, I'm also gonna
set minimum size.

70
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:48,158
Mimimum size.

71
00:04:48,158 --> 00:04:51,620
To prevent that form

72
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,850
getting too small.

73
00:04:54,850 --> 00:05:00,030
So, if I run this now it's gonna stop me

74
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:04,680
scrolling too much to the left and
squashing the form.

75
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:11,543
So you probably want to set a minimum size
for the components in your splitter.

76
00:05:11,543 --> 00:05:16,920
Okay, that's a bit of a diversion, but
now, we'll still find that if I

77
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:21,950
hide the form panel, show it again, I
still, I still got problem.

78
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,470
I need to move the splitter over.

79
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:28,724
So in the showMenuItem, I'm going to say

80
00:05:28,724 --> 00:05:34,176
SplitPanes set
DividerLocationFrontPanel.getMinimum

81
00:05:34,176 --> 00:05:38,820
size .getWidth and now getWidth returns

82
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:43,780
a double value and that would call the

83
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:48,960
variety of setDivider, sorry a form of
setDivider location.

84
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:54,830
That and it take a double from 0.0 to 1.0
and I don't want that.

85
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:58,430
I want the pixel width variety.

86
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:01,930
So I'm just going to cast this width to an
int.

87
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:05,540
So now, if I click Run and I go

88
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:10,380
to window show person form, Unshow it, and
Show again.

89
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:15,160
It's gonna set the divider to an
appropriate location.

90
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:19,539
And notice to make that work, I also set a

91
00:06:19,539 --> 00:06:23,600
minimum width on my form, a minimum size
on my form.

92
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,270
okay, so that's that.

93
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:31,780
And there's one other thing that is, is a
little bit interesting, which is that

94
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:39,088
on my SplitPane I can say I can set it to

95
00:06:39,088 --> 00:06:45,690
SplitPane.setOneTouch [UNKNOWN] tree.

96
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:52,620
If I do that it, puts in these little

97
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:59,850
icons here and I can just click those to
expand and contract like that and.

98
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:02,730
Or I could [UNKNOWN] using the splitter,
if I want.

99
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:05,240
I can have my form as big as I like.

100
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,840
It doesn't look very good big, so, in this
case, I don't know if that was

101
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:15,810
a really a useful thing to do, but it's
just a demo really of the JSplitPane.

102
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:19,658
So, in the next tutorial, we're gonna look
at

103
00:07:19,658 --> 00:07:24,510
JTabbedPane, and I'm gonna change this
table here into

104
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:27,450
a TabbedPane where one tab has a table on

105
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:30,030
and the other tab has something else on
it.

106
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:33,185
So join me again then, and until next
time, happy coding.

107
00:07:33,185 --> 00:07:36,244
