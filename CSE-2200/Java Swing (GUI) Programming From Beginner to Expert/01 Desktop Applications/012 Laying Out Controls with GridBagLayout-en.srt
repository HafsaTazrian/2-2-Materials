00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:05,205
[SOUND] Hello this is John from
Kevolveprogramming.com and in this

2
00:00:05,205 --> 00:00:11,507
tutorial, we'll gonna log cuts, grid back
layout, which is layout manager.

3
00:00:11,507 --> 00:00:15,370
So in the last tutorial, I created this
little,.

4
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:16,030
Program.

5
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:18,530
And in this panel here, I've actually
given

6
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:20,260
it, it's called form panel and I've
actually

7
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:24,540
given it some, some text fields and
labels,

8
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:26,500
which I now want to add to the panel.

9
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:32,690
And to do that I'm gonna use the most
powerful but also perhaps the trickiest of

10
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:39,350
the layout managers and you're probably
gonna wonder, as I show you this, if

11
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:45,940
it isn't easier to use a visual designer,
such as the Window Builder Pro, which

12
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:51,860
is free, a free Eclipse plugin I showed
you in the first tutorial in the series.

13
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:57,490
And the answer is that it could be perhaps
quicker but the

14
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:02,720
window the visual designers for Java at
the moment don't seem to be very good,

15
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,070
to be honest and you kind of, it's gonna
help a lot if

16
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:10,900
you know this stuff anyway and all the
Java Developers that I've actually worked.

17
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,940
Out with, or moan.

18
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,710
And, personally have pretty much shunned
visual

19
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:18,530
designers in favor of doing this by hand.

20
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:21,040
This seems to be a real culture of it in
Java.

21
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,290
And you'll probably see why if you start
using the Visual

22
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:26,050
Designers and you see how rubbish they
are, to be honest.

23
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:30,380
But, nevertheless, Window Builder Pro is
probably the best of the bunch.

24
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:36,130
So let's get on with it, having said that
and the

25
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:40,758
first thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna say
setLayout

26
00:01:40,758 --> 00:01:46,015
of course setLayout new grid,
GridBagLayout and

27
00:01:46,015 --> 00:01:51,350
GridBagLayout is so flexible that The
developers I've

28
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:56,560
knows including myself, tend to just stick
with this one layout and we don't really

29
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,570
use for example boxLayout or gridLayout
much.

30
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:04,840
Because this is so flexible once you've
learned the quirks of this.

31
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:08,080
You you can pretty much just use this for
most purposes.

32
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:14,610
So I'm gonna start by, now GridBagLayout.

33
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:20,240
you, you have a GridBagConstraints object
that you use

34
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:25,054
with grid back there, so I'll call that GC
and set that equal to a new

35
00:02:25,054 --> 00:02:30,486
grid bag constraints, and

36
00:02:30,486 --> 00:02:35,170
GridBagConstraints has a whole

37
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:39,790
bunch of fields, and you've got to
initialize those fields, before you use

38
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:41,558
it in any serious way.

39
00:02:41,558 --> 00:02:45,720
So, I'm gonna to start by doing that, I'll
say GC.,

40
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:51,360
and perhaps the most important is the grid
X and grid Y,

41
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,190
and grid X and grid Y so the idea is that
you're laying

42
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:58,980
out your components in a grid, but the
cells in the grid

43
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:04,590
can be very flexibly sized and they can
also span columns or rows.

44
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:10,560
And the cell at position zero zero is in
the top left hand corner here.

45
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,240
So we.

46
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:16,460
As we increase X we go from left to right,
and as we increase Y, we go

47
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:21,520
from top down to bottom, but if you just
have one grid cell, then its gonna

48
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:26,346
be in the middle, so you see how this
works as I go along here, nd I'm gonna say

49
00:03:26,346 --> 00:03:31,380
DC.grid Y equals null.

50
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:35,440
Now another very important thing to set
here is the weight.

51
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:42,682
I'm gonna say 2C.weight x equals one, one
and

52
00:03:42,682 --> 00:03:50,370
GC.weight Y equals one as well.

53
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:54,170
And the weight controls for a given cell,
the weight will control

54
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:58,200
how much space it takes up relative to, to
the other cells.

55
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,500
So this number here it doesn't have to

56
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,190
it's not important what the number is in
itself.

57
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:07,200
What is important is how this number
compares to

58
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,579
the other weights that you assign to the
other cells.

59
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:16,450
And finally, you might want to set
GC.fill.

60
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:20,670
That can be set to horizontal, vertical,
none, or both,

61
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:24,490
and that tells your components, whether to
take up all the

62
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:28,350
space in the cell, or not, and I probably
don't want

63
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:33,662
mine to, so I'm going to say grid back /u
constraints.none.

64
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:39,110
And it's pretty important to set this lot
at the start, because if you leave any of

65
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:41,920
it out you tend to get problems later

66
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,070
which can really have you tearing your
hair out.

67
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:51,560
So, first I'm going to add the, the top

68
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,160
leftmost component which is going to be
name labels.

69
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,500
We'll say addNameLabel.

70
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:02,730
These are the components I created in the
last tutorial in this series.

71
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:04,760
And I pass addGC there.

72
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:10,130
Now if I run this, name is also appearing
in the

73
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:14,500
center of the panel, because there's only
one cell at the moment.

74
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:18,750
So, whether you call it top left or top
right, or what you like,

75
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:23,280
makes no difference because if it's only
one it's gonna be in the middle.

76
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:29,820
But let's now, say, GC.gridX equals one.

77
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:35,942
So I'm going from left to right, and
GC.gridY still equals zero, and

78
00:05:35,942 --> 00:05:42,000
soGC.gridY is not changing and I'm gonna
reuse this grid back constraints, but

79
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,550
the reason that I'm a typing this again is
just to make it

80
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,920
clearer the code, what's that link, and

81
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,900
that is a big problem with
GridBagConstraints.

82
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,290
You tend to lose track of what's
happening.

83
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:58,480
So you really need to divide up your form
into kind of logical parts, you

84
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:02,710
know, and la, maybe put comments in in the
code and that kind of thing.

85
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:04,510
Or use tricks like this as well

86
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:07,440
of redefining variables that you don't
need to.

87
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,399
Okay, so let's do add name field.

88
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:13,770
Co, comma GC.

89
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:17,450
And if I add that it's gonna be one along
an X.

90
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:18,980
It's gonna be here.

91
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:24,650
If your text field appears extremely tiny,
you've probably forgotten to

92
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:29,920
set the text field width here, so don't
forget that.

93
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:37,072
And, so let's go ahead and say DC.gridY
now equals one

94
00:06:37,072 --> 00:06:42,320
and DC.gridX, I'm going to set that to
zero and to add

95
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:48,056
occupation label, occupation label

96
00:06:48,056 --> 00:06:53,510
comma DC, so this is adding a new row, so
I've gone down one in Y and it's down

97
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:59,230
here, and, then I'll say GC.gridY

98
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:09,079
still equals 1 and GC.gridX equals 1 as
well and add occupationField.

99
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:13,950
OccupationField, GC.

100
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:16,420
And so now, I've got my field in here.

101
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:19,850
And finally, I'm going to add a button
down here.

102
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:25,680
So, i'm going to say GC.gridY equals 2 and
GC.

103
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,640
GridX equals 1.

104
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,280
So I'm adding it in the second column.

105
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:37,700
The first column is number zero of course,
and add Okay button, [UNKNOWN] see this?

106
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:41,830
Now if I run that, that button's going to
appear down here.

107
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:43,350
Okay.

108
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:46,760
So that's great except that it looks like
a donkey's

109
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:50,670
ass because of the alignment and
everything's completely spread out.

110
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:54,000
So the first thing I'm going to do is I'm
gonna

111
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,150
to move these labels over to the right,
set it there flush

112
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:00,580
with the text fields and I'm gonna make
sure that the

113
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,590
text fields are moved over to the left,
rather than being centered.

114
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:11,510
And the way I do that is before I add the
labels, I have to say GC.anchor.

115
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:18,810
And this specifies the side of the cell
that the control sticks to if you like.

116
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:23,050
So I'm gonna say GC.anchor equals grid.

117
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:29,180
And let's try
GridBagConstraints.LINE_STAR_LINE_START.

118
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:32,600
So LINE_STAR means, it's like the start of
a line.

119
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,640
It's like, basically East is down here.

120
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,530
There's also first line start, which would
be up

121
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:43,620
here top left or last line start down
here.

122
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:51,310
Last line end is bottom left and first
line end top, sorry bottom right.

123
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:55,600
First line end top right, you, you
probably get the idea.

124
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,960
So me, I'm gonna use lines start here.

125
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:01,910
And I'll copy that because I want to also
make the

126
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:05,640
second label go to the, actually I don't
want a line start.

127
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,980
I, I actually want it to be line end
because I want it to

128
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:14,490
stick to the right hand side of the cell,
which is in the first column.

129
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:21,740
And, and I also want my my button and my
label,

130
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:28,810
my text fields to the LINE_START, to the
left hand side of the second column.

131
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:35,410
So here if I go to the field and I, change
this to LINE_START

132
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:40,160
and before I add the occupation field,
I'll have LINE_START as well.

133
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,790
And I don't actually need to repeat it,
but just for clarity here.

134
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,330
I'll set this to line stop as well,

135
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:48,490
although it's still LINE_STOP because I
used it here.

136
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:52,840
Okay, so there we go.

137
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:59,180
The alignment is just a little bit better
and know I would like I'd like these

138
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,530
the, the, controls to be up here somewhere

139
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:06,880
rather than spreading out vertically like
this and the

140
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,290
way I'm gonna do that is I'm gonna make
the first and second row is very small.

141
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:16,690
And I'm gonna make the last row take up
all the space, just to start with.

142
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:24,670
So, I'm gonna go to the weight Y, and this
is the weight Y for first row here, and,

143
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:30,430
let's take this out because I have to set
this out, I have to set this every time.

144
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:31,790
I'm gonna.

145
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:32,760
Move this to here.

146
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:41,480
And let's let's maybe, rearrange this a
bit.

147
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,400
I know, it's as good as it is because this
is all the

148
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:47,340
first row so let's put some comments in
here which will help a lot.

149
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,680
First.

150
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,750
First row.

151
00:10:52,570 --> 00:11:00,590
And let's have a comment here so in the
next section I've got gridY equal to one.

152
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:03,610
So then it's going to be second row.

153
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:05,870
And finally.

154
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:11,190
I've got the button which is in the third
row down here and these are the kind

155
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:16,210
of lengths you' have to go to keep things
clearly with GridBagLayouts this is the

156
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:24,020
third row and for the first row I'm gonna
set the the weight text

157
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:30,510
and weight wanna set the weight Y I can
leave the weight text as it is I think.

158
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:35,280
I can set the weight Y, to a very small
value like 0.1.

159
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:42,590
And, I can have, that set to 0.1 for the
second row as well.

160
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:48,030
And then for the third row, I'm gonna set
the weight Y, to a much

161
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:51,850
bigger value, like 1.9, so the third row
takes up the most to the space.

162
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:56,800
And if I run that it looks like this,
which is an improvement.

163
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,340
If I, let's make this last row even bigger
and see how that looks.

164
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:03,580
So yeah now these are more bunched
together.

165
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:10,310
And I want the button here to be not
[UNKNOWN] which is here on the left.

166
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:12,830
The first LINE_START which is here.

167
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:15,760
Because conceptually it's like this is the
first line here.

168
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,780
Then the, the line.

169
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,250
And then the last line.

170
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:22,500
And then we've got lines start and end.

171
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:26,500
So let's make that first LINE_START for
bottom, the anchor.

172
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,600
So here I can say, instead of lines.

173
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,745
Start first.

174
00:12:30,745 --> 00:12:34,570
LINE_START and if I run that, the buttons
now can

175
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:37,050
appear, which I think you'll agree looks a
lot better.

176
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:41,790
And there's one last little change that
I'd like to make here, because I

177
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:45,770
want my labels to have a little bit of
space up to the end.

178
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:51,570
And I could do that actually by by just

179
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:55,120
putting some some space actually in the
label text

180
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,600
itself, but because I want to show you
something

181
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,000
quite important, I'm gonna do it a
slightly different way.

182
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,650
I'm gonna use a indent.

183
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:05,980
So I'm gonna look for where the labels are
now.

184
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:11,290
So here's the occupation label and up here
is the name label.

185
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:18,215
And before writing those, I'm gonna say
GC.indent, I think it's called indent.

186
00:13:18,215 --> 00:13:20,140
GC.inset.

187
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:20,640
Sorry.

188
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:28,910
Equals new insets and if you look at the
insets class, so

189
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:34,140
you Ctrl+ Shift+O type the import and put
the cursors there and let's have a look.

190
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:38,790
It's got the arguments or.

191
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:39,940
Top left, bottom right.

192
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:44,550
Although, to be honest with you, sometimes
I try inserting values

193
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:47,400
for insets and they seem to be in the
wrong order.

194
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,750
So let's try this today and see what
happens anyway.

195
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:52,330
I want to have an inset on the right
there.

196
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:59,390
So what I'm gonna try doing is, this is
top left bottom

197
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:05,270
right, like that, and I'm gonna have the

198
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:11,500
same insects before the, occupation label
and.

199
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:15,560
For the other controls I'm going to have
the inserts.

200
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:19,590
If I remember right I can just set set
these to null.

201
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:25,200
But if that doesn't work, I'm going to set
it to like a blank inset object.

202
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:29,060
So after I've set the insets there, I've
then done away with that.

203
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:33,500
And I've set the inserts here so I'll do
away with that again here.

204
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:37,530
And let's also do away with it before I
add the button here.

205
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:39,490
And let's see if that works.

206
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:41,080
So if I run that.

207
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,270
And I've got an error because my memory
[UNKNOWN] part here.

208
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:51,080
And I actually need to do just a need
blank insets instead of null.

209
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:58,570
Accept that, there's no there's no
construct with no parameters, so

210
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:02,010
let's set it to naught, and I'm confident
this will work.

211
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:07,350
So wherever I've got insets equal to null,
I'm gonna set it equal to naught.

212
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:08,490
So that there's no cutting.

213
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:13,470
And of course if I was worried about
efficiency here, I could create

214
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:17,930
just one insets subject or two in this
case, and I could reuse them.

215
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:21,120
Where I need them, if I run that.

216
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,520
Now we've got a little bit of space.

217
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,460
It should be five pixels, but who knows if
it really

218
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:30,830
is exactly five pixels, right on the side
of the labels here.

219
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:36,450
That's it for this tutorial, in the next
tutorial, I'm.

220
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:40,385
Hooking this little panel up to that so it
does something.

221
00:15:40,385 --> 00:15:44,250
And we're gonna use [UNKNOWN] listener
model that I've already explained.

222
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,930
But then if you didn't fully understand it

223
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:48,320
last time cuz we're gonna go over it
again.

224
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:54,290
And I'm actually gonna use an event object
to carry

225
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:58,810
information from here up to the
controller, the main frame.

226
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:01,380
And I'm gonna output it.

227
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,840
In this text area here.

228
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,390
So until next time, happy coding.
