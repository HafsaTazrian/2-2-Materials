00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:05,800
Hello, this is John from
CaveArtProgramming.com and this is

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,950
a tutorial on adding menus to your swing
application.

3
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:14,570
So in a moment I've got this swing
application, and there's no menu here.

4
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:18,520
And in this tutorial I'm going to show you
how to add a really basic menu

5
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:22,310
and I'm going to tell you the kind of
minimum you need to work with menus.

6
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:26,000
And then we'll look at some more advanced
stuff in the next tutorial.

7
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:32,400
So I'm going to start by going to my main
frame .Java here where I

8
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:38,340
just create the main frame and I'm going
to give that a new method called, it's

9
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:44,230
going to be private create menu bar create
menu

10
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:47,120
bar.

11
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,320
Now if you look at an application like
Eclipse, for example, this.

12
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,920
The thing across the top is called a menu
bar.

13
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,100
We have file, edit, source, refactor, and
so on.

14
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:02,420
And the, each of the separate things here
are called menus.

15
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:05,970
And the items in a menu are menu items.

16
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:14,960
So, I'm going to start by creating a new
JMenu bar, which I'll call menu bar.

17
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,130
And I'll set that equal to a new JMenu
bar.

18
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:21,010
And I'll just return that from this
function.

19
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:22,740
So return menu bar.

20
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,430
And let's set return type of this
function.

21
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:30,390
To jmenubar like so at the import there.

22
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:40,370
And now, in my mainframe constructor here,
I can just do set jmenubar.

23
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:44,660
Now don't call set menubar by mistake,
because,

24
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:49,020
there's a kinda historic method here
called set menubar.

25
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,120
And set menu bar is not compatible with
JMenu bars, so

26
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:57,340
you need to set J menu bar, not set menu
bar.

27
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,770
So if I run that, it's not gonna look any
different at the moment,

28
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:03,350
although this may be a faint, so the line
there, where there, many will appear.

29
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:09,802
And now let's get this a couple of menus,
so I'll have a JMenu.

30
00:02:09,802 --> 00:02:19,100
File menu equals new JMenu and that's
called a file as is traditional and

31
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:27,625
oh, at the file menu, to the menu bar, so
I'll say menu

32
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:34,670
bar.@ and I will push in the file menu
like so,.

33
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:42,510
And let's also have a JMenu window menu

34
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:48,520
equals new JMenu, so I just add two for
the moment, just to kind of demonstrate

35
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:54,408
the principles involved and I'll say
menubar.add

36
00:02:54,408 --> 00:03:00,270
window menu, and if I run this.

37
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:02,740
So now we've got two menus but they've got
no items.

38
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:07,180
So let's add some menu items to them.

39
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:12,140
So in the file menu let's have.

40
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:16,440
A I'll create a JMenu item here.

41
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:26,520
And I'll call this let's call it export
data.

42
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:31,250
And I'll set that equal to I'll call it
export data item.

43
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,630
And I'll set it equal to a new JMenu.

44
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:37,900
An item and I put a text in there.

45
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,870
So, if you look at a file menu usually the

46
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:43,050
text begins with capital letters and if
you have two words

47
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:47,260
usually they're capitalized and if you
bring up some other dialogue

48
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:51,030
you put an ellipses on them, so and that's
worth noting.

49
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,860
For consistency with other applications.

50
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:59,280
So, the same UJ menu item and export
data...

51
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,010
And that's gonna bring up a dialogue that
allows me to export my data.

52
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:06,000
So, I'll add the JMenu item import there.

53
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,460
And let's have a importDataItem as well.

54
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:16,610
So, let's say JMenuItem

55
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:20,880
ImportDataItem and that's going to say
import data.

56
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:23,820
And these are going to allow me to

57
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:27,080
import and export data from my
application, ultimately.

58
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:33,620
And let's add both of these menu items to.

59
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,130
To the file menu.

60
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:38,110
So in fact, I'll just, I'll put this

61
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:40,420
down here so that we're grouping
everything together.

62
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,946
And I'll also jMenuItem.

63
00:04:42,946 --> 00:04:48,530
And as is traditional, let's have a
exitItem.

64
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:51,910
So an exit item on the menu.

65
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:54,990
So if you look at this file it's got Exit
down there.

66
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:56,530
Let's add one here as well.

67
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,410
So exit.

68
00:04:58,410 --> 00:04:59,120
There we go.

69
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,930
That quits the application.

70
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:05,930
Oh, I could put the equals new JMenu,

71
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:11,410
menuItem accept.

72
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:15,430
Okay so let's add those to the File menu.

73
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:20,621
I'll say, fileMenu.add exportDataItem.

74
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:24,180
So exportDataItem.

75
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:32,550
And fileMenu.addi mport, data item.

76
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:36,840
And, then its other fileMenu,add
separator, like that

77
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,940
to make a nice, so if you look

78
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:42,210
at menus often they've got like these
Nearly

79
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:45,820
invisible horizontal lines in them to
separate logical groups.

80
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,500
So we're gonna add one of those separator.

81
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:57,210
And file menu.add exit item, like this.

82
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:03,565
Now for the, For the window menu I'm gonna
have a

83
00:06:03,565 --> 00:06:10,280
JMenu I'm gonna actually have a sub menu
here.

84
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,130
And I'm gonna call the sub menu.

85
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:14,030
So I go to window here.

86
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:19,020
Here's I've got a show view kind of item.

87
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,030
So, I'm gonna say here.

88
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:25,060
I'm gonna have a sub menu called show.

89
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:33,130
So I'll call this, show menu equals new
JMenu, show.

90
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:39,110
And, show menu is gonna show sub menu,

91
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:44,070
it's gonna have, At the moment just one
item.

92
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:48,520
And that item is gonna be, Is gonna be
JMenuItem.

93
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:55,905
And it's gonna be called showFormItem

94
00:06:55,905 --> 00:07:01,430
= new JMenuItem.

95
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:02,590
And it's gonna say.

96
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:10,730
Lets call it, person form maybe, I don't
really know what to call it at the

97
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:17,530
moment, but that will do, and so I'm gonna
add the show menu.

98
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:22,381
To the window menu, so I'll say window
menu.add

99
00:07:22,381 --> 00:07:28,440
show menu and I mustn't forget to add the
show form item

100
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:33,430
to the show submenu, cuz this is slanting
more complex than it really is.

101
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:37,708
But, you'll see in a minute how this looks
[INAUDIBLE] show menu don't have to show.

102
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:42,881
PerformItem.

103
00:07:42,881 --> 00:07:46,960
And now, I think I'm good.

104
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:53,289
So, I've got the, I've got fileMenu and
I'm adding items to the fileMenu here.

105
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:59,270
While I'm creating items there and putting
them here, without setting up the file

106
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:04,340
and then I add the file menu to the menu
bar, and the window menu.

107
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:07,240
So I create the window menu here, and that
[UNKNOWN]

108
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,520
you move that down to organize this a bit
more logically.

109
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:14,220
So I create a [UNKNOWN] menu.

110
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:21,000
And I add a show form item to the show
menu, and

111
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,530
I add the show menu to the window menu,
and the window menu I add to the menu box.

112
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:27,960
Let's have a look and see how that looks.

113
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,890
So I've got a file menu here.

114
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:32,650
It's got export data, import data and
exit, and the windows.

115
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:33,430
It's got show.

116
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,550
If I go to that, this submenu opens up,

117
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:37,590
which just has one item in it at the
moment.

118
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:47,630
Now I, there's lots of things you can do
with menus, and one useful thing

119
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:55,750
to do here is that this, you can actually
have check boxes in menus.

120
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,410
And I'm gonna, in the next tutorial, I'm
actually going to show

121
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:03,840
you how to change this menu item here, so
it uses a chatbox.

122
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:08,330
And we're going to use that to show and
hide this form here.

123
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:12,980
And there, there are very similar things
you do in menus.

124
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:16,580
And we're going to look later on at
mnemonics

125
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:21,490
and accelerators and pop up menus and
things like that.

126
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:22,390
So join me agin next time.

127
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:25,320
Time when we'll be making this menu
actually work.

128
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:30,200
And it's worth just mentioning here, if
you haven't got the patience to look

129
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:36,890
through more tutorials on menus, then you
can just add action listeners to your

130
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:40,310
menu items, and you can respond to them
just like you would with a

131
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:47,470
normal button, and that will be enough to
get you working with menus already.

132
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:50,660
But, as I say, in the next tutorial we're
looking at check boxes and menu.

133
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:51,560
So join me again then.

134
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:56,739
And until then, happy coding.

135
00:09:56,739 --> 00:09:57,209
