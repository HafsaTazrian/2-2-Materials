00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:04,830
Hello, this is John from
caveofprogramming.com,

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:07,050
and this is a tutorial on

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:12,840
basically make, making dialogs look
prettier and this also applies to forms.

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:19,140
So, we've got this preferences dialog at
the moment i'm gonna top this up a bit.

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,100
By, using a couple of panels, within this,

6
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:27,200
dialogue and giving, giving one of them, a
border.

7
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:32,610
And we're also gonna, we're also gonna use
like, two, or

8
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:37,660
three different layouts within the same,
dialogue to make it look good.

9
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:43,210
So if you're using a visual designer like
NetBeans

10
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:48,150
or even better, the free Windows, free
Eclipse plugin Window

11
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:52,950
Builder Pro, and you, you might want to
skip this tutorial.

12
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:54,290
But actually it will give you some

13
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:56,450
information, because even if you're using
these, facial

14
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:59,650
designers, you can still, make use of the

15
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:04,080
techniques in this tutorial, to design
your dialogues.

16
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:07,540
So the first thing I'm gonna do is assign

17
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,440
an accelerator to this dialogue because as
a general principle.

18
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:16,330
it's, it's not good to try to develop

19
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:19,200
an application where you have to run the
application,

20
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,290
and then perform some other slightly
laborious action, just

21
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,100
to see the results of what you're working
on.

22
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:27,400
So, I wanna fix it, so that when the
application

23
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,860
runs, all I have to do is press Ctrl P to

24
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:33,085
bring up this preferences dialogue and
that will save me some

25
00:01:33,085 --> 00:01:36,080
time, 'cuz I won't have to keep going to
the menu.

26
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,710
So let's go to the, [UNKNOWN] package
here,

27
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:42,470
and go to the, Mainframe which is here.

28
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:48,040
And search for the accelerators codes I've
already

29
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,080
added a couple of accelerators to menu
items.

30
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,420
And I'm just gonna copy these and I'll

31
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:58,560
change this to preferences, I preface item
that one.

32
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,764
And I'm gonna set the key to be P here, so
if I run this now.

33
00:02:04,764 --> 00:02:09,770
And do Ctrl P, that brings up my dialog,
just to speed things up a bit.

34
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:11,810
So let's go the dialog and work on that,

35
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:15,840
I'll go to the preferences dialog here,
maximize my [INAUDIBLE].

36
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:22,210
And it's here, maximize the wrong window,
here we go, Ctrl-M

37
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:27,610
and now I wanna create a couple of panels
which

38
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:31,670
I'm gonna use, we're gonna have one panel
that's gonna control my, it's gonna

39
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:37,880
contain my, labels text password field and
spinner.

40
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:42,540
And the other part is gonna contain my
buttons so the first thing I'm gonna do

41
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:51,680
actually, is, take all this kind of layout
specific code and so.

42
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,850
Down to here, and I'm going to do Ctr-lX
to cut it,

43
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:58,510
and I'm gonna replace all that with a
function which I'll call,

44
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:04,470
lay out controls, I think that will do the
trick.

45
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:12,180
And, I'll implement that function down
here so, I'll have, put private void

46
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:17,250
lay out controls, and, let's just paste
the original letters.

47
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,190
[INAUDIBLE] code in there.

48
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:21,130
So that should work exactly the same as
before, and it does.

49
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:29,050
Now, in layout controls here, I'm gonna
just do Ctrl-Shift F to format that.

50
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:35,370
I'm gonna start by creating a couple of
panels, so I'll have a J panel

51
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:40,070
controls panel equals new J Panel, and

52
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:48,100
I'll have a J paneled buttons panel equals
new J panel.

53
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:53,220
Now, so that I can better keep track of,
which panels

54
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:57,020
were, I'm gonna start by setting very
simple borders on each one.

55
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:04,350
So I'll say, controlspanel.setborder set
border there.

56
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:13,800
And let's just use border factory.create,
oh yeah, I've got

57
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,930
to have the right spelling for start that
will help Ctrl-shift-O to add the import.

58
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:20,690
And then the auto complete, let's have
create

59
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:25,970
line border, and I'll give that color of
black.

60
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:33,600
Color, at the input for color, and then we
can do, color.black, just

61
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,015
so that we can see what's going on, and
I'll copy that line.

62
00:04:36,015 --> 00:04:41,350
And, okay page

63
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:47,020
down or up by mistake there escape that
copy that line and then, paste

64
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:52,236
that in then, I can use, I can set a
border on my buttons panel as well.

65
00:04:52,236 --> 00:05:00,040
Now I'm gonna be adding these panels to
the dialog as a whole,

66
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:05,540
and the first thing I'm gonna do here is
instead of setting grid by layout on the

67
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:11,290
actual panel, I'm gonna set it on the
controls panel and I'm gonna add stuff

68
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:16,680
to my controls panel instead of adding it
to this main direct to the dialog.

69
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,790
So I'll do, set that on the controls panel

70
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:20,500
and then I'm gonna look down here, and
I've got

71
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,520
six different controls that I want to add
to the

72
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,720
controls panel instead of adding them to
the main panel.

73
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,620
And they are the three labels, and three
import

74
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:35,560
controls so got the user field and its
label.

75
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:40,320
And you've got the password and it's
label.

76
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,570
And we've also got the port, spinner and
its label.

77
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:52,030
And for the buttons panel here, the
buttons panel, and,

78
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:57,160
so let's go down to where you are at the
buttons now, so that's right at

79
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:02,340
the bottom here, and let's delete, let's
change this comment here

80
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:07,670
to buttons Panel, and on the buttons

81
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:12,762
panel, I'm gonna set the layout, and I'm
gonna set that to new

82
00:06:12,762 --> 00:06:15,450
flow layout.

83
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:17,951
cuz I want my buttons to be next to each

84
00:06:17,951 --> 00:06:21,583
other actually I want them to align, to
the right

85
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:25,055
hand side with in my panel.so I'm gonna
say here,

86
00:06:25,055 --> 00:06:30,250
in a constructor of flow layout, I'm gonna
pass flow layout.right.

87
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:34,250
To say that I want my buttons right
aligned, and then I can add

88
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:40,010
the buttons to the button panels, let's
get rid of actually first I'll paste in

89
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:45,150
the add, and then I'm not gonna use the GC
anymore because the flow out, flow layout

90
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:50,550
uses that controls and there's no extra
perimeter to add character this.

91
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:51,900
And now the final thing that I mustn't

92
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:58,530
forget, of course, is, add sub tunnels to
dialogue.

93
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:04,410
And on the dialogue itself, I'm actually
just gonna use a nice

94
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:08,980
and simple, border layout, which we've
seen before, cuz we used it there

95
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:16,155
in the main frame, so I'm gonna say new
border layout, and, I'm gonna add the,

96
00:07:16,155 --> 00:07:23,546
these [INAUDIBLE] in now, so I'm gonna say
add, [INAUDIBLE]

97
00:07:23,546 --> 00:07:29,760
controls panel, and I'm gonna add order
layouts.center.

98
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:38,132
And then I'm gonna add the buttons panel
add border, border layout.south,

99
00:07:38,132 --> 00:07:44,558
there we go, and let's take a look and see
how How that looks.

100
00:07:44,558 --> 00:07:50,630
So,Ctrl P and, there we go.

101
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:54,200
So, it's pretty much the same as before
but now I've got two panels.

102
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,670
This Is panel at the top, which is my
controls panel

103
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:58,720
and a panel at the bottom, which, which
is, bottom, which

104
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,510
is my buttons panel um,and see that I've
got the [INAUDIBLE]

105
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:07,920
console buttons there, now and they're
right aligned using their flow layout.

106
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:12,620
One thing that I might wanna do is, make

107
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:17,250
the buttons the same size, which could
look nicer.

108
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:23,210
So, let's, let's just do that It'll be a
nice little touch there I'm gonna say,

109
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:25,910
So, we'll go to, up here, before the

110
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:28,380
button's routed although I don't suppose
it matters.

111
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:34,147
And then let's say, dimensions

112
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:39,946
button size let,s It call it btnSize
equals

113
00:08:39,946 --> 00:08:45,390
and I'll do CancelButton, cuz

114
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:50,870
that's the bigger button.get let's try get
size, and see if that works.

115
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:54,760
And then I can do on my okay

116
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:59,476
button, okay button, actually that's not
dimension, it's for dimension and,

117
00:08:59,476 --> 00:09:04,329
Ctrl-shift-0, okay

118
00:09:04,329 --> 00:09:10,808
button.set, preferred size, and

119
00:09:10,808 --> 00:09:17,230
btnSize in there I'm not sure if this will
work, let's just check.

120
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:24,079
So, in fact my okay button has completely
disappeared, let's try and get preferred

121
00:09:24,079 --> 00:09:30,610
size I think that's probably right and
then click Run and Ctrl-P there we go.

122
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:34,170
Now we've got the okay button this is same
size, as cancel button.

123
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:36,130
And, and the reas the reason for that, I
guess is that,

124
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:41,050
the cancel button after you assign text to

125
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:43,230
it, which happened when I corrected the
button, had

126
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:48,820
a preferred size, I wasn't sure if it was
preferred size or, the actual size of it.

127
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:52,983
And that's the size that it wants to be
and I [UNKNOWN] and then I've just done

128
00:09:52,983 --> 00:09:55,390
set, I've set [INAUDIBLE] size on the okay
bond

129
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:58,150
to make out the same preferred size, and
it's

130
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:03,150
actually the flow layout manager that
actually determines the

131
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:05,230
size of the button but that's obviously
doing get

132
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,100
preferred size to find out what size they
wanna

133
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:11,100
be it's making buttons that size which is
nice.

134
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:17,150
So, now let's work there on these controls
here, so the first thing I wanna do is

135
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:23,590
write a line, these labels so that they're
closer to the form controls that

136
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:29,230
they represent, and to do that, it's it's
the same as we've seen before, when we

137
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:32,750
were laying out the person form, that's on

138
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:35,673
the left hand side of the application
here.

139
00:10:35,673 --> 00:10:40,729
I'm just gonna go to it's gonna to be a
repeat of what we've seen before, so

140
00:10:40,729 --> 00:10:45,785
we're just gonna to the when, where I'm
adding stuff I just label

141
00:10:45,785 --> 00:10:51,180
here, adding stuff using grid background,
using grid by constraints.

142
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:57,312
That's said GC.anchor, to anchor it to the

143
00:10:57,312 --> 00:11:03,007
to the right-hand side, so that gonna be
grid

144
00:11:03,007 --> 00:11:08,956
back constraints.um.um, the east right?

145
00:11:08,956 --> 00:11:12,750
So let's just check so, everything for the
moment, is gonna be anchored to

146
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:16,450
the east because I haven't reset it with
the controls so there we go.

147
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:21,540
And I'm gonna take this and just before we
add the

148
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:26,878
other two labels I'm gonna set it to that
so here's

149
00:11:26,878 --> 00:11:31,610
one label and the other label is, here.

150
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:35,470
And just before I add the controls, i'm
gonna,

151
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:38,140
say that I want to find anchor to west.

152
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:45,318
So, there's one, and, here's another and
the other control is up here.

153
00:11:45,318 --> 00:11:53,310
So, let's see and do Ctrl-P, and there we
go, so now we've got them aligned.

154
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:56,750
And actually, before I move on, there's
one

155
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,760
thing I just wanna quickly tell you about

156
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,070
GridBagLayout because I don't know if I'll
get

157
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:04,980
another chance within this application,
because completed it.

158
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:12,190
But if you want something to span, like,
two or more,

159
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:17,990
grid cells either vertically or
horizontally, you can set GC.grid width,

160
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:22,230
or grid height and the number of cells you
wanna span,

161
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:25,320
and then you can have control of spans of
multiple cells.

162
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,380
which is Something very handy, but i'm
probably not gonna

163
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:30,660
use that, in this application I just
wanted to mention it.

164
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:35,070
And I think the other, or, the kind of
other main aspects,

165
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:37,450
grip that constraint, constraints, and
grip

166
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:39,847
back [UNKNOWN] we've pretty much covered.

167
00:12:39,847 --> 00:12:44,290
So, now i'm also gonna add, before I add
the label, I wanna add some space

168
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:50,560
on the right hand edge of the label there
because they look a bit strange

169
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:56,040
and being you know, completely next to the
controls.

170
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:59,710
So to do that, I'm gonna say GC.inserts,
and again

171
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:04,190
this is something that we seen before,
equals new insets.

172
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:08,590
And I want, I think, if I do Ctrl-Shift-O,

173
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:11,920
and look at this, it's top left bottom
right.

174
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,510
So I want the right to be padded a bit, so
I'm gonna say,

175
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:20,320
top left, bottom and let's make the right
padded by, I don't know, 15 pixels.

176
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:25,060
And let's just see how that looks, that's
gonna affect

177
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:27,590
all the controls, at the moment
[INAUDIBLE], there we go.

178
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:32,690
That's not too bad at all actually, and I
could reuse this,

179
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:37,960
inset actually in fact I will lets just
cut that and say, right, padding

180
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:46,190
and up here, I can say, inset, right,
padding.

181
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:51,140
And then equals new insets, and so that's
my right padding.

182
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:56,430
And I also want, no padding 'cuz I want, I
don't want the, input

183
00:13:56,430 --> 00:14:01,870
controls to be padded at all so i,m say
insets, no padding, equals new

184
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:06,986
insets and that's just gonna be [UNKNOWN],
no padding.

185
00:14:06,986 --> 00:14:13,690
And, so, I'm gonna set the insets to right
padding

186
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:22,180
before I add the labels, and it says one
and this is the one down here new label.

187
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:26,200
And I'm gonna set it equal to no padding
before I add the control, the actual

188
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:32,900
fields so this is gonna be no padding, no
padding, and let's

189
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:39,690
copy that, and look for the places where I
add fields, so, these fields [INAUDIBLE]

190
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:46,365
pulled spinner, and now if I run that, it,
it looks a lot better.

191
00:14:46,365 --> 00:14:52,215
Now, there's a lot of space between these
two controls, and when I

192
00:14:52,215 --> 00:14:57,720
design a form, the technique that I showed
you is I made

193
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:04,176
everything, I made the bottom cell much
bigger than the other cells.

194
00:15:04,176 --> 00:15:11,229
And then I made these controls uh,kind of
line up with the top of the cell.

195
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:14,210
And this as well, and then we had, so we
had space

196
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:17,210
at the bottom, and they're all kind of
bunched at the top.

197
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:21,110
So, I mean the bottom cell's the biggest
by far and then made everything bunch up

198
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:22,770
at the top, that's the [INAUDIBLE] that's
the

199
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:25,970
technique I used in designing this form
here.

200
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:28,130
But I'm gonna do something slightly
different here

201
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:30,479
in this, you know more than one way to

202
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:37,140
skin an egg, or I should say, you know, I
don't know, you know what I mean.

203
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:40,400
So, what I'm gonna do here is, I'm gonna
first of all

204
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:44,740
reduce the size of the dialogue
considerably, so let's go to where I

205
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:49,560
do set size on the dialogue here and I'm
gonna Make that like

206
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:54,890
to, I don't know, let's try 200 and 200,
that's probably too small.

207
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:58,180
And add those, that's too small, and let's
make

208
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:02,650
the width wider let's try 300 there and
run that.

209
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:10,160
And that looks quite a lot better and what
I'm also gonna do, is, let's make it,

210
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:17,370
make it a bit narrower let's try 270, see
how that looks.

211
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:21,500
And maybe, for the height, let's try 180,
and see how that looks.

212
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,910
So, you can play around with this kind of
thing, I'm quite happy with that.

213
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:34,430
And, actually, I'm gonna also, I'm gonna
add, a border around the top form here,

214
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:39,460
and, and I'm gonna make it so that, I
want, I want it so that there's a border

215
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:42,530
around form itself, but then a space
around

216
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:45,530
that border, and so actually this is
probably

217
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:49,972
gonna have to be a bit bigger, so let's
set it for the moment to like 340.

218
00:16:49,972 --> 00:16:53,440
so let,s basically, make this much bigger
for

219
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,660
the moment so, it's gonna look like that.

220
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:03,560
Now let's put a border around that, around
the top form.

221
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:06,970
So I've already got a line border, which
is no use

222
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:09,000
to me, I'm gonna get rid of that in a
minute.

223
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,360
But I'm gonna use two borders here, one
nested in the other, and the first one,

224
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:19,520
is gonna be a title border so I'll call
it, title border and

225
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:24,789
I'll set that equal to border
factory.create

226
00:17:24,789 --> 00:17:29,180
title border and I'm gonna pass

227
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:34,350
in a string here and that's gonna be
database

228
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:42,050
what should we call it, database
preferences maybe database

229
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:45,500
preferences, that'll do for the moment
anyway prefer and siz.

230
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,000
And,

231
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,190
so that's going to create a nice, kind of,
border with title

232
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:54,960
in front, I can show you that if I go to
control border

233
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,274
and we set the title border, and let's get
rid of the

234
00:17:59,274 --> 00:18:02,890
actually I'll need the border on the
bottom border just in a moment.

235
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:07,358
So if I run that now and do Ctrl-P, we've
got this border around it.

236
00:18:07,358 --> 00:18:09,490
And I'm gonna put another border, which is
just gonna be an

237
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:15,030
invisible kind of margin, around the title
border to space out that.

238
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:21,633
So, I'm gonna say here, border,
spaceBorder,

239
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:28,264
Border equal
borderFactory.createEmptyBorder.

240
00:18:28,264 --> 00:18:33,130
And I'm gonna get that, I'm gonna put some
I'm gonna fill in

241
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:36,220
these values here to see how much space I
want to create there.

242
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:39,520
Let's create an entire and say, let's call
it

243
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,900
n space equals, I'm not really sure, let's
try 15.

244
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:46,730
So let's put in here space, and we'll have

245
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:50,290
the same space all the way round, like
this.

246
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:55,460
And to create a border that goes around

247
00:18:55,460 --> 00:19:01,150
the two, I can use borderfactory.create
compound border, so

248
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:02,420
the border that I'm gonna set in the

249
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:05,270
controls panel will be a mixture of these
two.

250
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:10,303
So I'm gonna use border factory.create
compound

251
00:19:10,303 --> 00:19:15,040
border and then I have to parse the
outside border, which is gonna be a space

252
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:22,330
border and the inner border here, it's
gonna be the title border like this.

253
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:28,240
Let's see how that looks Ctrl-P I think
that looks quite a lot better, I'll get

254
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:37,460
rid of the line border around the the
buttons panel.

255
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:44,780
And if we run this and that doesn't look
too bad I can live with that.

256
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:48,000
And of course, you could play around with
it more like, I don't

257
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,720
know we could try, there are all kinds of
things that you could do.

258
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,740
I could try making this a bit, maybe, not
quite

259
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:59,240
so tall maybe it looks a bit better must
be

260
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:02,350
not quite so wide, either but this is the
sort

261
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:05,810
of thing that you could spend an awful
long time on.

262
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:09,170
And if you have a, visual designer, to
hand

263
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:13,040
of course, it's gonna be quite a lot
quicker.

264
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,082
And so, but, personally, I don't mind
doing this

265
00:20:15,082 --> 00:20:18,530
by hand and because compared to the amount
of time

266
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:20,690
it takes you to put together the real guts
of

267
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:25,140
the application often it's, it not really
that much time.

268
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:30,240
Okay, so, that's it for this tutorial in
the next

269
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:35,385
Tutorial we're gonna look out setting
Icons on buttons, [INAUDIBLE] not.

270
00:20:35,385 --> 00:20:38,380
Uh,we will look at that in time um,uh,
because

271
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:42,440
I'm gonna take this, very rough looking
toolbar at the

272
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:45,600
top and I'm gonna use a proper j toolbar
class

273
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,190
and I'm gonna put Icons on these buttons
and things.

274
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:51,290
But next time, actually, I'm gonna make
this connect to a

275
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:55,880
database, so join me again then and until
next time happy coding.
