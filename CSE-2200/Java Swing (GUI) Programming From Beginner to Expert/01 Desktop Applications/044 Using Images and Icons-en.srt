00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,100
Hello this is John from
caveofprogramming.com

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,720
and this is a tutorial on adding

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:13,340
icons to your buttons using images that
you can create yourself or download.

4
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:17,555
Now, probably the first thing to say is
that if you

5
00:00:17,555 --> 00:00:22,481
go to Google and search for, something
like Java graphics repository.

6
00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:28,397
You can get this you can get this JAR here
from sun, that

7
00:00:28,397 --> 00:00:35,451
contains various icons for most purposes
in the so called Java look and feel.

8
00:00:35,451 --> 00:00:39,510
Because [INAUDIBLE] applications can be
set to use different look and feels.

9
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,690
And this is designed for the Java one.

10
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:46,300
But you can also create your own icons.

11
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:51,690
And in this tutorial I'll show you how to
drop your own

12
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:56,560
images into a package, and to use those on
buttons, but

13
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,220
what I'm gonna show you will also apply to
using images

14
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:05,060
directly from JARs that you've downloaded,
and so we'll basically cover both.

15
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:11,714
Now, because I wanna show you how to use
the individual images in

16
00:01:11,714 --> 00:01:16,658
case you want to use your own, I've I've
actually downloaded that

17
00:01:16,658 --> 00:01:21,880
JAR, and, and, I've I've unzipped JAR I've
unJARed it.

18
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:26,839
And, I've I've gone to directory here and
found two good icons that I want to use.

19
00:01:26,839 --> 00:01:32,385
So I got the Refresh 16, or 16 by 16 pixel
gif icon in the same 16

20
00:01:32,385 --> 00:01:38,540
by 16, and I want to use those on my
buttons in this application here.

21
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:42,400
I'm gonna start by creating a new package

22
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,200
to put the images in, so I've right
clicked

23
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,790
my start folder here and I'm gonna go to

24
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:52,500
New > Package, and I'm gonna call this,
images.

25
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,300
Click Finish.

26
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:58,020
And now, I could, browse to that folder,

27
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:03,900
on my computer, and, but I do proctors
here.

28
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,540
You can find the actual folder, there it
is.

29
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:10,780
But you can also just drag and drop them
in, so I'll take the last approach.

30
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:15,808
And I'll go to my icons that I downloaded
here, so

31
00:02:15,808 --> 00:02:20,975
I've got refresh 16, and I also want save
16.

32
00:02:20,975 --> 00:02:25,080
I'm just gonna drag those into the to this
package here.

33
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:30,520
Now, before I can load the images and the
clips,

34
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:35,190
I need to make Eclipse copy those to my
build folder.

35
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:40,010
I'm just going to right click source here,
and go to refresh.

36
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:43,980
If you ever find if you ever find that

37
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:48,842
you can't load resources visible in your
package browser here.

38
00:02:48,842 --> 00:02:52,010
Try right-clicking refresh, because that
often helps,

39
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:53,520
so now I've got my images here.

40
00:02:55,190 --> 00:03:01,090
So I'll go to the toolbar.javaclass and,
and

41
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:05,520
I'm gonna give this a method for loading
images.

42
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:10,550
And I could load images very simply with
just one line here add on a button.

43
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:14,280
But I'm gonna actually create a method,
just because I

44
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,800
want that method to warn me if the image
isn't present.

45
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,910
Because it's easy to have problems with
images not loading.

46
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,540
And I want to avoid that.

47
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:27,080
And I want a war, a warning if it can't
find the image.

48
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,200
So, I'll create a method here.

49
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,680
Private is gonna return an image icon
object.

50
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:38,530
I'll call that create icon, and I'll pass
in here a path

51
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:44,040
which will be the path, packing, kind of,
path of the image to load.

52
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:48,710
Let's have the [INAUDIBLE] icon.

53
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:53,567
And now I'm gonna say,
getClass.getresource.

54
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:58,740
So getClass will get me the class object.

55
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:02,270
There's actually there's actually a class
called class.

56
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:08,840
And that will get me the class object
associated with this toolbar.Java.

57
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,379
Which is it doesn't really matter but it's
J panel.

58
00:04:11,379 --> 00:04:16,700
And then I'm gonna use get resource method
of the class, class.

59
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:23,020
And what that does is it uses a class
loader to actually load your resources.

60
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:25,470
So ClassLoader's the thing that loads your
Java classes.

61
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,850
And I wanna use that same, piece of

62
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:31,040
technology to lose, use to load my images
here.

63
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,650
Now I'm in here.

64
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:35,040
I'm in the GUI package.

65
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,516
This toolbot.java is in the GUI package.

66
00:04:37,516 --> 00:04:42,830
So the kinda URL of the image is gonna

67
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:46,020
look like, well actually let's leave that
for the moment,

68
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:49,170
because let's just fill in this general
method, so I'm

69
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:53,490
gonna load images from a path like this,
and that's.

70
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:57,850
Is gonna return the, a, a url.

71
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:01,860
So I'll say url, url equals, and this is

72
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:07,070
the URL the resource and locator of my
image.

73
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:10,900
And at the end put there javanet,
java.neturl.

74
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:16,191
And, and now I can say url.get.

75
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:19,548
[SOUND] url dot, oh, sorry, don't do that.

76
00:05:19,548 --> 00:05:26,981
Let's say ImageIcon, icon equals new image
icon and, if I remember

77
00:05:26,981 --> 00:05:34,770
correctly, can pass the URL as an argument
in the icon constructor.

78
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:36,940
And then finally I can return the icon
like

79
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:39,979
that [SOUND] and its worth mentioning here
that when you

80
00:05:39,979 --> 00:05:42,459
create your image icon, so this is the,
this is

81
00:05:42,459 --> 00:05:45,142
the little class that is going to contain
my image.

82
00:05:45,142 --> 00:05:50,212
As a second argument here you can supply
description and that's for kind

83
00:05:50,212 --> 00:05:53,722
of visually impaired people because I
guess

84
00:05:53,722 --> 00:05:58,330
screen reading technology can read that
description.

85
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:02,660
I'll leave that as is for the moment.

86
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:06,970
So I'll return my image icon here, and I
just wanna, my purpose in creating this

87
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:11,940
method is really so I can just say here,
if URL is equal to

88
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:17,074
null then that means we couldn't load it,
and I'm just gonna say syserr control

89
00:06:17,074 --> 00:06:22,323
space this is going to add up print ln,
unable to load

90
00:06:22,323 --> 00:06:27,960
resource, say unable to load image
actually, and plus half.

91
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,460
There we go.

92
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,090
Now I can use that.

93
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:36,560
To set images on my toolbar button, so I'm
gonna get

94
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:42,470
the save button here, and I'm gonna say,
savebutton.seticon.

95
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:46,220
And you can use to set, this technique
with labels as well.

96
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,920
Even [UNKNOWN] really big images.

97
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:52,056
If you want a big image somewhere in your
program you can

98
00:06:52,056 --> 00:06:55,546
just put a label there and load a big
image onto it.

99
00:06:55,546 --> 00:06:59,442
I'm gonna say set icon, and I'm gonna

100
00:06:59,442 --> 00:07:04,176
use the create icon method that I just
created.

101
00:07:04,176 --> 00:07:13,090
And then I'm gonna say in here I'll pass
it a path.

102
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:18,790
Now the path, I'm in the GUI, I'm in the
GUI package.

103
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:24,160
If the image's package was within the GUI
package, I could say images

104
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:29,945
here, stroke, and the name of the image to
load so save.

105
00:07:29,945 --> 00:07:35,980
16.gif, but because I'm actually in the
GUI package already, I

106
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:40,070
need to go to that kind of, root, of these
packages,

107
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:42,850
with a slash at the beginning, and then go
up into

108
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:47,170
the image's package, and then I think I
might find the icon.

109
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:53,000
The important thing here is, this
directory this package or directory,

110
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,990
depending on how you look at it, shows
exist on the class path somewhere.

111
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:02,340
So it, it, this doesn't have to be within

112
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:05,290
your project folder or anything, but it's
gotta be.

113
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:11,830
On the class path somewhere, so, okay, so
let's see if that works.

114
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:16,570
Now, if I run that and let's go to App
here and run that.

115
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:23,130
Now, I've got save icon on my button
there, and I'm gonna do the same with

116
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:30,060
the refresh button, so I'm just gonna copy
that, and let's make this refresh.

117
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:34,870
I think it's called refresh 16, there, and
now I

118
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:41,110
maybe have one, one plant line there, it's
from that.

119
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:42,370
Okay.

120
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:44,370
That didn't work.

121
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:45,120
Why didn't it work?

122
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,920
Because I've got the save buttons that the
refresh buttons.

123
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,940
The refresh button.

124
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:50,500
That should work.

125
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,000
Okay.

126
00:08:52,752 --> 00:08:56,240
Now that's it for this tutorial.

127
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,540
I must say it's a very powerful technique
and

128
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,770
you can move big images for that on to
labels.

129
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:02,140
It's great.

130
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:05,080
But in the next tutorial, I'm gonna make
this

131
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,900
look more like a tool bar by removing the

132
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:11,538
text on the buttons and I'm gonna use a

133
00:09:11,538 --> 00:09:17,800
Jtool bar class instead of my panel class
here.

134
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:22,175
So join me again then, and until next
time, happy coding.

135
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:22,447
[SOUND]
