00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:06,140
Hello, this is John from
caveofprogramming.com and in this

2
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:09,980
tutorial, we're gonna look at how you can
use

3
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:14,730
IDs in your list boxes, rather than
relying on,

4
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:16,619
the strings that you output in the user
interface.

5
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:20,150
And that we're also gonna hook up a little
bit more of the

6
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:26,280
code in this little application that we've
been working on here, and here.

7
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:34,750
And I'm gonna make it output some stuff
here in this panel.

8
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:36,820
When I click, Ok on this form.

9
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:44,496
So At the moment, what's happening is if I
click, Ok on the form after I've selected

10
00:00:44,496 --> 00:00:47,734
something in this list my code is in this,

11
00:00:47,734 --> 00:00:51,880
in the, in the class that represents the
panel.

12
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:55,570
It's just retrieving the string.

13
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:57,070
From the list box.

14
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:00,810
And a problem with that is usually the
kind of string

15
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,460
is a thing that might change if you decide
to reword it.

16
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:04,630
Or something.

17
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:06,560
What you, you really want usually is you

18
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,600
want some ID that corresponds to that
string.

19
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,990
So, if this was a table in a database, and
we're

20
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:15,700
gonna get into databases later on in this
series of tutorials.

21
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:21,240
Then each age category would probably have
an ID,

22
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,080
and it's that ID that you usually really
want.

23
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,910
So to make this work.

24
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:30,100
What I will do is I'm gonna write a new
little

25
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:35,612
clasp, and because it just quite small on
the utility class.

26
00:01:35,612 --> 00:01:40,190
I'm gonna just write it here in the file
along with form panel.

27
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:45,860
And things that I'm writing to my list box
are age categories.

28
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,110
And I'm gonna call this.

29
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:54,080
Class age category and let's

30
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:59,960
give this a constructor, and each age
category I'm gonna say category

31
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:07,250
has a id int id, and it has a string.

32
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:11,190
Text that is a descriptive string that
appears in the user interface.

33
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:19,096
So let's give this a private string text
and

34
00:02:19,096 --> 00:02:25,590
also a, I'll put it up here actually, a
private int ID.

35
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,300
And in the constructor.

36
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,910
I'm just gonna set that text and ID.

37
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:38,020
So, this dot ID equals ID and this dot
text equals text.

38
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:41,900
So, it's just a little utility class for
matching up ID's.

39
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:49,240
And string for the should be this, for the
age categories, and

40
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:55,060
what I can do, is I can add that class to
my list box instead of strings.

41
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:59,790
So let's look at where I'm adding the
elements to my list box, and it's here,

42
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:05,080
it's I'm adding it to the model, remember,
of the of the J list.

43
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:11,220
So instead of having under 65 I'm saying
new age category.

44
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:17,430
It's a little class I just created and
have I can have an id here

45
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:21,980
and then a string and I wanna do the same
thing

46
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:28,920
down here and here and I'm gonna change
the ids.

47
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:33,740
So, each one has a unique id, and let's
make that one and make that two.

48
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:38,640
And now if I run this what's gonna happen
is I'm gonna see this.

49
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,555
This is the result of doing toString on my

50
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:45,945
AgeCategory objects and to actually make
it look like nice.

51
00:03:45,945 --> 00:03:51,286
All I've gotta do is give this AgeCategory
class,

52
00:03:51,286 --> 00:03:56,750
a two string method, so public String
toString, and.

53
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:00,310
Return text, cuz I, this is the text that

54
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:02,790
I actually want to display, which is the
text that

55
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:09,500
I'm passing in here and now if I run that
it looks just the same as it did before.

56
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,270
But the advantage is that when I click the
button

57
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:17,830
instead of saying
ageList.getSelectedValue, Well

58
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:19,860
actually, I still wanna do that.

59
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:22,760
But it's or do I?

60
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:28,340
Actually, I think what I want is get
selected

61
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:30,870
yeah.

62
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:34,250
Get selected value should do the trick.

63
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,520
But instead of casting it to a string, I'm
gonna.

64
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:43,790
Cast it to a AgeCategory like that, and
then call this AgeCategory.

65
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:51,890
So, if I run that when I oh yeah, need a
semicolon there.

66
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:59,480
When I click, Ok, it's gonna get my age
category object from the list.

67
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,110
So I'm just doing, I'm still doing
ageList.getSelectedValue.

68
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:08,860
I can't actually remember if that was the
right method, but it is getSelectedValue.

69
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:13,310
But it's just that the values in my list
now are not strings.

70
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:15,940
They are age category objects.

71
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:19,130
And the advantage of doing this is that
here,

72
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:22,880
I've now got access to the string, and the
ID.

73
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,840
Which is probably what I really want.

74
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,350
So, let's go down here.

75
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:28,150
And let's give it a public

76
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:33,540
public int getID.

77
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,485
And I'll just return the ID there.

78
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:44,810
And here when the button is clicked, I can
now say hcup dot let's just.

79
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:46,870
I'll put the ID for the moment.

80
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:50,940
And it I run that, so when I click, Ok
down here in the console,

81
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:56,310
I get the ID [UNKNOWN] string, which is
what you want most of the time.

82
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:58,650
Because usually this information is gonna
be stored in a

83
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:04,990
database, and having the string text is
not usually any use.

84
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:12,380
Okay, and now I'm gonna at this point so
like

85
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:19,390
what I'm gonna do now is just make that
text appear on the right hand side here.

86
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:22,170
And if you're a fairly advanced java
programmer you might wanna skip that bit.

87
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:24,450
Because all I'm gonna do, is I'm gonna
modify the

88
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:28,150
event model that carries the information,
sorry, the event object.

89
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:31,000
It carries information from this panel, up
to the

90
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,290
main frame, and then down again to this
text panel.

91
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:38,470
I'm gonna modify that to accept my id,

92
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:43,030
which is one of the advantages of using
events.

93
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:48,570
So when I get, when I collect all this
information.

94
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:49,860
I'm saying, form listener.

95
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:52,050
Form event occurred, and passing it this
event.

96
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,170
And a form listener.

97
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:58,510
The thing that's listening, actually, in
this case, is the main frame.

98
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:00,050
So, let's go to form event here.

99
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:02,830
And it's already got a get name, and a get
occupation.

100
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:05,350
But I'm gonna give it a private.

101
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:07,570
Int ageCategory.

102
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:13,150
And I'm gonna let's put this here.

103
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:18,760
Let's say int age, ageCat.

104
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:25,700
And let's say, this.ageCategory equals
ageCat.

105
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:28,390
And let's give it a get age category.

106
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,328
So public.

107
00:07:29,328 --> 00:07:34,810
Void getAgeCategory and all that has to

108
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:38,480
do is just return ageCat of course,
ageCategory.

109
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,320
So yeah, it's not public void actually
it's int and so

110
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:48,560
all I've done here is just make this event
object capable

111
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,000
of storing a bit more information and then
here in the

112
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,950
form panel, I can pass in not only the
name and.

113
00:07:54,950 --> 00:08:00,350
Patient, also the age cut dot, dot get ID.

114
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:05,910
And now finally in my main

115
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:12,050
frame here I can add to the text panel
some more stuff here.

116
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:20,280
I can say So, I've got name and occupation
and, and I could also output,

117
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:29,240
Let's see, I could say int age cut equals
e dot get h cut.

118
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:33,850
So, I'm just using the method I've just
declared on the form we found.

119
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:35,900
And here, I can output.

120
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:44,550
The age category, so let's do plus age
cap,

121
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:48,100
age capped, and I'll still have the new
line there.

122
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:54,120
So, eclipse itself hopefully putting in a
double quote I don't want.

123
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,548
And if I run that.

124
00:08:56,548 --> 00:09:00,610
So [COUGH] so now excuse me if I fill this

125
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:06,070
in John software say software, and I'm
believe I'm 1865.

126
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:12,410
So, if I run that it's it's gonna output
here John software one, h category one.

127
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,270
So you see this, this using an event model
is

128
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:19,610
very flexible because you can transfer a
lot of information.

129
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:21,500
From this form, just using your object.

130
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,970
You don't have to keep you don't have to
make this

131
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:27,970
form event occurred have more and more
arguments all the time.

132
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,000
In the next tutorial, we're gonna look at

133
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,920
another wonderful form widget that you can
use.

134
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,360
We're gonna look at the combo box.

135
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,500
So, join me again then.

136
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,185
And until next time, happy coding.

137
00:09:40,185 --> 00:09:43,444
