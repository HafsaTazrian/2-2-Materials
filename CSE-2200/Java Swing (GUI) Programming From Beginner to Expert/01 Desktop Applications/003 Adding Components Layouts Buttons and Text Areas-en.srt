00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:02,940
Hello, this is John, from
caveofprogramming.com

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:07,010
and in this tutorial, we're gonna look

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:12,440
at the border layout, layout manager and
at text areas a little bit.

4
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:18,220
So, in the last tutorial I showed you how
to create, a

5
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:23,390
basic application, which looks like this,
such as the window and it's blank.

6
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:28,320
And in this tutorial, we're gonna start
adding some controls to this window.

7
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:33,570
Now, this is the point at which swing gets

8
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:35,490
a little bit complex,, but once you can
get

9
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:38,360
over this hump you can tackle all kinds of

10
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:43,690
projects because to actually add
components to a window.

11
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:48,750
You, need to know something about, layouts
managers and

12
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:52,370
there are several different layout
managers in, in Java swing.

13
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:55,270
And the task of layout managers, is to

14
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:58,760
decide where to put the components in the
window.

15
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,030
And also to kind of move those

16
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:05,050
components to appropriate locations and
resize them appropriately.

17
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:08,490
When you expand or contract the window and

18
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:10,940
that's where a lot of the complexity comes
from.

19
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:14,010
And we're gonna start with a very simple
layout manager here.

20
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:23,090
So at the moment if, if I look at this the
code that we've got so far we've just got

21
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:26,880
a really simple we're creating a frame,
setting the size

22
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,360
of it, setting what happens when you click
across any corner.

23
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,470
And setting it to visible and so that's
the operation when a frame's been set up.

24
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,290
And what I'm gonna do for a start in this
tutorial is something

25
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:41,380
that you'll probably want to do most of
the time, which is I'm gonna

26
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:46,500
create my own custom child class version
of JFrame so that I

27
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,479
can put codes in a constructor, that will
add components and we'll do this stuff.

28
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:57,790
So, let's just right click the Default
Package > New class.

29
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:01,670
And, I'm gonna create a new class called
Mainframe.

30
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:07,300
And, and that's gonna extend JFrame.

31
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:11,150
So a handy tip is to give your child
classes

32
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:13,340
names that reflect, reflect what kind of
thing they are.

33
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:15,640
So, if you're creating a customized
button,

34
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,350
call it something gorilla button and the

35
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:22,230
customize frame, something go to frame, so
on, to kind of help you keep track.

36
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:31,352
And I'm gonna give this a constructor, so
public name frame like this.

37
00:02:31,352 --> 00:02:35,080
And the first thing I'm gonna do here,
let's take a look at this app again.

38
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:40,280
So, here, we're setting the title by
calling this constructor

39
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,640
of JFrame and I'm gonna move that code
into here.

40
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,370
I'm gonna say, super to call the super
class constructor and I'm gonna say in

41
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:53,090
there, hello world, so that's kind of

42
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:57,980
equivalent to whoops, didn't meant to do
that.

43
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:01,910
That's kind of equivalent to, this code
here and

44
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:08,060
now I'm gonna change this JFrame frame
equals new JFrame.

45
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:10,100
To just a simple command.

46
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:14,290
New name frame, to create a new class

47
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:18,860
of the mainframe type, which I'm defining
now.

48
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:21,460
And let's get rid of that, and let's take
this

49
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:26,150
code and move it into the constructor of
my new class.

50
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:29,600
So, my main method is just going to be
very simple.

51
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,610
It's just gonna run this main frame
object.

52
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:35,720
Save that and I'll go to main frame.

53
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,940
And then in construct I'll paste this in
and now we don't need

54
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:45,580
this, frame reference because we can call
the methods, of the parent class.

55
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:46,550
Directly, like this.

56
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,865
so, at the moment.

57
00:03:49,865 --> 00:03:53,790
All I've done now, really, is divide the
existing code into two separate files.

58
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:55,560
And that will just run as before.

59
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:00,510
But now, it's kind of, neater to add, more
components to main frame.

60
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:02,950
Now, the first thing to do when you're

61
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:07,480
adding components is to set an appropriate
layout manager.

62
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:13,250
And as I mentioned in the inch dot tree
tutorial, if you go to Google.

63
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:18,590
Whoops, go to Google and search for visual
guides

64
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:23,840
layout swing, something like that, you get
this rather handy page.

65
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,820
And this shows you the different kind of
layout managers that you can use.

66
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:31,350
In a most flexible and complex form which
we will cover later on, this grid

67
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:36,430
backed layout that lets you put things in
a sort of very, very flexible grid format.

68
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:38,190
And, but there's several others you can
see,

69
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:40,210
most of which we'll be covering to some
extent.

70
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:45,120
And the one that I'm gonna show you here,
is this border layout.

71
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:49,380
And border layout is often used, to kind
of

72
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:53,310
sculpt the, the very basic outlines of an
application.

73
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,440
So you could use this type of tool bar at
the top,

74
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,590
let's say, and panels in, you know, in the
middle, left and right.

75
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:03,718
And maybe something in the bottom, like a
status bar or something.

76
00:05:03,718 --> 00:05:05,930
What border layout does, is it just allows
you to add

77
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:10,030
components, in the center position or the,
the compass points, basically.

78
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:14,328
So, let's use that to add a couple of
components.

79
00:05:14,328 --> 00:05:18,820
I'm gonna go here, to my main window and
say, set layout.

80
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:22,580
And I want to pass that, an object of the
type border layout.

81
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:26,230
So, I'll say new border layout here.

82
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:32,260
New border layout, and add the import with
CTRL+SHIFT+O in Eclipse.

83
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,890
And then, let's create a couple of
components that I want to add.

84
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:37,180
And you'll often want to, create

85
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:40,350
your components as private instance
variables so

86
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,450
that you can access them from

87
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:44,980
multiple methods, although, that's not
always necessary.

88
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:48,230
I'm gonna have here a, a JTextArea.

89
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:53,850
A text area is a region like this editor,
that I'm

90
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:57,520
working in here, which just contains a
whole bunch of text.

91
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:02,610
And if you just want one line of text
you'd use, JTextField and I'll call

92
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:07,900
that TextArea, and, and I'm also, I'm
gonna add the import.

93
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:11,760
And then I also have a private JButton.

94
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,050
Let's just call that btn.

95
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,490
And, at the import for JButton.

96
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:18,200
And you can either create your new

97
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,240
components directly here, in which case
they'll be

98
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,130
created, of course, when a class is
loaded,

99
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:23,850
or you can create them in your
constructor.

100
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:27,340
In which case it'll be created when the
object is created.

101
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,740
I, I don't see that it really makes a huge
amount of difference.

102
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:36,530
Well, I'm gonna say text area here equals
new JTextArea, like that.

103
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:40,190
And, I'm gonna say button equals new
JButton.

104
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:44,950
And let's just put some text on that
button, says, click, click me.

105
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,000
And now, I can add those components.

106
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:53,720
To my main frame, using this layout
manager.

107
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:58,450
Strictly speaking, I'm adding it to the
content pane of the JFrame.

108
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:03,590
The content pane is like a panel, that the
JFrame contains, which will contain the

109
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:07,010
components, but we don't need to worry
about that here, I can simply say add.

110
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:12,270
Passing the controller I want to add, so
let's say, text barrier and then pass

111
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:18,010
in a static constant of border layout, to
say where I want to add this control.

112
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:23,857
So, I'm gonna say border layout dot
center.

113
00:07:23,857 --> 00:07:27,970
Like that, so I can add the text area
right in the middle.

114
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:35,728
And I'll add the button, in the south
position I'll say, add

115
00:07:35,728 --> 00:07:43,000
button B-T-N, border layout dot south,
like this.

116
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,975
And, so these controls aren't gonna do
anything in a moment,

117
00:07:46,975 --> 00:07:50,800
but now if I run that, I've got this
application here.

118
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,500
And I can click the button, it does
nothing.

119
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,810
And I can type, text in here and so on.

120
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:57,160
And in the next tutorial, we're gonna look
at

121
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:01,560
extending this application and starting to
make it do stuff.

122
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,250
So, that's all for this tutorial, join me

123
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:06,780
again next time, and until next time,
happy coding.
