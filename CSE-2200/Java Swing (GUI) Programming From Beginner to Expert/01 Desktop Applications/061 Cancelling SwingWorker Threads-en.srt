00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:07,504
Hello, this is John from
caveofprogramming.com and in

3
00:00:07,504 --> 00:00:10,847
this tutorial we're going to look at
cancelling worker

4
00:00:10,847 --> 00:00:14,046
threats and more importantly, I'm going to
show you

5
00:00:14,046 --> 00:00:18,200
how to Implement this cancel button on
this dialogue.

6
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:22,620
So, to get the dialogue bit working, the
first

7
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,339
thing I'm going to do is create a new
interface.

8
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:33,890
And this interface, I'm gonna call
progress, progress, dialogue listener.

9
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:40,530
And I'm just gonna give that one method,
public void,

10
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,642
cancel, let's call it cancelled, actually.

11
00:00:46,642 --> 00:00:48,520
That'll do the trick.

12
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:53,840
now, in the, progress dialog, I'll give
that a private,

13
00:00:55,660 --> 00:01:00,500
member variable, of type progress dialog
listener.

14
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,000
So that type is the interface that I've
just implemented.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,460
And I'll give it a method for setting
that.

16
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:11,010
So, we'll say, public void, set.

17
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:13,950
Set listener, I'll call.

18
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,370
Call it.

19
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:16,740
Progress.

20
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,520
Then that's gonna accept progress dialogue
list now.

21
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,460
And it's just gonna say disk top list now.

22
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:25,300
This top listener.

23
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:30,258
List and equals, listener.

24
00:01:30,258 --> 00:01:33,640
And, and, and also well.

25
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:38,250
What I want to do is, ultimately, I want
to have the message panel, listen to the

26
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:43,960
progress dialog, and if someone clicks
that button, it's gonna invoke

27
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:50,160
the message panel's can't solve, function.

28
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,360
In fact, maybe I should call it something
else, I'll just call it.

29
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:58,050
That's click progress dialog council cuz
this

30
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:01,420
going to be a method in message panel.

31
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:03,767
I'm just going to have to implement this
interface

32
00:02:03,767 --> 00:02:05,830
so we want to give it a suitable name.

33
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:10,000
And, and, so I'm gonna add a listener to
the cancel button here.

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,830
I'm gonna say add, well cancel button dot
add action

35
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:20,320
listener, and it's gonna be, that's gonna
be a new action listener.

36
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:28,029
Let's implement the missing method in our
little anonymous class here.

37
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:35,440
And if someone clicks a cancel button, it
will invoke this method.

38
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,180
And then I'm gonna say if listener is not
equal

39
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:43,119
to naught, in other words if something's
listening to this dialog.

40
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:46,040
Then, I'll call this naught, and it's

41
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,170
only got one method, progress, dialogue,
cancelled.

42
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,509
Okay, so far so good.

43
00:02:54,509 --> 00:03:00,080
And also actually while I'm at it I'm just
gonna fix a

44
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,830
little thing here because this dialogue as
we've written here is pretty generic.

45
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:09,430
And I wanna make it even more generic by
just making this message customizable.

46
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,030
So I'll cut that.

47
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:14,400
And I'll put the string title here, and
call this, title.

48
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,570
And now, let's go and do some work on
message panel.

49
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:21,520
So, in message panel, for a start, I'll
put a title in here.

50
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,620
That's better.

51
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:28,688
So now, progress, the progress dialog, is,
I think, a fairly generic class.

52
00:03:28,688 --> 00:03:32,740
And, I'm gonna make Message panel

53
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:35,450
implement that interface that I just
created.

54
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:44,330
So, I'll say implement progress dialog
listener, like that.

55
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:45,560
Save that.

56
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,730
Let's go to this and add an implemented
method.

57
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:53,070
And on the bottom here now we've got our
progress dialog cancelled.

58
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:55,210
And let's just see that working.

59
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:59,800
So, I'm gonna put these all in here
because

60
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,230
I like to check things as I'm going along.

61
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:07,640
And I find that even software developers
like me

62
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,610
with decades of experience, well I've got
more than

63
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:14,400
a decade, we still make mistakes all the
time,

64
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,060
so it's good to check things as you're
going along.

65
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:19,150
And so, let's go, let's have a look.

66
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,250
I'll bring up the dialogue and click

67
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:26,370
cancel, and you should see down here,
cancelled.

68
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:30,490
But, I'm not, so there must be something
I've forgotten.

69
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:31,700
And, let's see.

70
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,170
So.

71
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:36,010
Yeah, I forgot to add the message panel as
a listener.

72
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:38,590
See, this is exactly what I was talking
about.

73
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:48,898
Okay, so I've got a say now, and progress
dialogue dot add.

74
00:04:48,898 --> 00:04:52,958
Add progress, add listener, I think I
called that add listener.

75
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:58,440
And I'm not getting much success with the
auto complete here.

76
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,810
Let me check, progress dialogue.

77
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:04,750
So, I have given it a message called set
listener, that's what we want.

78
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:07,650
Let's save that, that might help.

79
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:09,069
And then auto complete set.

80
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,890
And this and that's the one I want.

81
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:14,330
And the list is going to be this dialogue.

82
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:18,460
So this is something I've done several
times before now.

83
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:22,249
I, I've created an interface prefaced that
of this note with one method.

84
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:32,110
I gave the progress dialog an instance
variable of that type, and, I provided it

85
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:37,230
with a set method to set it this there and
then if someone clicks the cancel button.

86
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:40,020
I, if that listener instance for example
is not

87
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:43,750
null, I call it's progress style of cancel
method.

88
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,690
And so you see, I'm keeping a clean
separation

89
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:48,370
here between the progress dialog and the
message dialog.

90
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:51,620
So the progress dialog doesn't know
anything about a message panel.

91
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,950
And that makes it much more reusable

92
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:57,920
and your application hopefully easier to
debug.

93
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:02,300
And I'm not saying the message panel, set
listener this, and then

94
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:07,340
of course I have to implement progress
dialog listener in the message panel.

95
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:09,030
Now, let's check that it works.

96
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:11,850
And this time I'm pretty confident that it
will.

97
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:15,070
So I'm gonna bring up the dialog up there.

98
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,220
And I'm going to click Cancel.

99
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:19,030
And we've got Cancel coming up down there.

100
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:21,440
Now there's one other possibility here,
because someone could

101
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,650
click Cross and in the dialogue to close
it.

102
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:29,376
So let's say here in the progress dialog.

103
00:06:29,376 --> 00:06:36,830
SetDefaultCloseOperation
jDialog.doNothingOnClose.

104
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:43,040
Because I don't want it to do anything
when someone clicks our cross.

105
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:49,130
And then I can say add window listener.

106
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:53,440
And I'll say in here, new window adapter.

107
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,190
And window adapter is a abstract class
implement,

108
00:06:57,190 --> 00:07:00,780
or the methods of of a window listener.

109
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,447
So now I can click in here

110
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:09,060
and go to override source, overwrite
document methods.

111
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:14,120
And I just want the window closing method,
because I want to stay in here.

112
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,770
Let's just check if this works.

113
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:21,760
In fact, what I'll do is say if this does
not equal to null

114
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:26,790
again, I'll call the I'll call it, I'll
call it progress dollar council method.

115
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,460
So let's check that that works as well.

116
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:36,140
Let's go here, bring up the dialog and
click the cross in the corner.

117
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,280
And it also says can't sort, so that's
what I wanted.

118
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:42,280
Now, let's actually get onto the business
of terminating

119
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,480
the thread, and this is gonna be pretty
simple.

120
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,820
It's just that there's gonna be a few
little tiny complications here.

121
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:56,800
So, the first thing is that my swing
worker thread, my reference to it is a

122
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,890
local variable and I want to be able

123
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:03,100
to access it from the Progress Style
Console method.

124
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:07,940
So let's get rid of the declaration here,
paste it up here.

125
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:12,890
Private, private SwingWorker worker.

126
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:13,910
There we go.

127
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:19,810
And now, in this cancel method, I can say
if

128
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:25,660
worker is not equal to null, which it
shouldn't be null because.

129
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:31,000
People shouldn't be seeing the progress
dialog unless unless

130
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,130
they have actually unless the thread has
actually been created.

131
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:41,480
But just in case they manage to because
we've, I

132
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,790
think we create the, the dialog first and
then the thread.

133
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:48,730
It's just in case they manage to click
bottom in between that millisecond

134
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:53,640
interval in between the dialog being set
physical and the worker being created.

135
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,460
Let's just check that it's not equal to
null.

136
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:00,750
And then let's say worker.cancel.

137
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,480
So, and said equals true.

138
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:09,390
And I'm calling this swing work a cancel
method and if you, this has this one

139
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:12,660
argument which I've set to true and the

140
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:16,890
argument actually says, is called may
interrupt running.

141
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:21,040
So if this would be false, it would cancel
the thread only and been

142
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:26,600
executed yet, and I want it to be
cancelled, if it has been executed.

143
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:31,230
Now, what will actually happen at the
moment, will be that wherever I've

144
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:36,220
got like a thread.sleep or a wait or
something that could be interrupted in

145
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:43,000
my processing, if I call cancel on the
thread, then that's gonna, dig

146
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,760
an interrupted exception will be thrown
from

147
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,490
wherever it can within my, processing
code.

148
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:53,090
And it may be that there's nowhere in your
processing code that you call

149
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:56,578
try to sleep or wait, and there's no way
that it can be interrupted.

150
00:09:56,578 --> 00:09:58,143
I'll show you what I mean.

151
00:09:58,143 --> 00:10:00,770
If I now cancel this thread I'm gonna get.

152
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:02,930
Like a horrible looking stat trace down
here.

153
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,340
And let's have a look at where that's
coming from.

154
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:09,810
So, if we can find any details in here.

155
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:11,950
It's coming from here.

156
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:16,120
So this get method, for a start, is I'm,
in

157
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,750
my done, I'm still calling get, even
though it's been cancelled.

158
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:22,490
Now, we wanna sort that out and fix that,
so I'm gonna say

159
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:29,030
progress dialogue to set visible, we
false, we always wanna do that in done.

160
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:33,270
But, then I'm gonna say if is cancelled
and

161
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:35,200
this will tell me if the thread is being
cancelled.

162
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,180
And if it has, I'm just gonna return
because I don't wanna go any further.

163
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:43,760
I don't wanna try to get anything here if
it has been cancelled.

164
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,460
And let's run it again, see what it looks
like now.

165
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,930
I think I'm still gonna have some stack

166
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:52,100
trace, stack traces there, so we'll cancel
it.

167
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,460
And we've still got stack trace.

168
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,630
And let's see where this is coming from.

169
00:10:55,630 --> 00:11:00,760
So now if I look at this, it's coming from
my message server.

170
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,760
And you see in my processing code, I've

171
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,450
got this thread.sleep, which can throw an
interrupted

172
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:10,460
exception, and if the thread that it's in

173
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:13,590
is interrupted, it will throw this
interrupted exception.

174
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:19,110
And by interrupted I mean if you call
cancel on the worker, basically.

175
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:24,020
And so I'm just gonna get rid of this

176
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:26,286
message, 'cause if this is interrupted, I
don't care.

177
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:30,820
I just wanted to shut up basically.

178
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:34,130
And let's now run it and see if we've got
any more in there.

179
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:34,930
That might be it.

180
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:36,290
I'm not sure.

181
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:37,640
And click Cancel.

182
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:42,320
And now, it's failing silently, which is
good, except I

183
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,120
want it to actually be cancelled, not to
carry on.

184
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,639
And to fix that, because it's not enough
in general to-

185
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:55,900
It's not enough to simply call cancel on
the thread 'cause all cancel

186
00:11:55,900 --> 00:12:01,298
does is it sets this flag which can detect
by the isCancelled method.

187
00:12:01,298 --> 00:12:06,520
And your thread.sleep's will detect that
but I need to actually look at where I'm

188
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:11,860
processing stuff and to stop doing that
processing if the threads cancelled.

189
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:16,560
So my message panel, I'm retrieving
messages from the message server, and I

190
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:22,280
actually want to say if is cancelled,
cancel, I just want to stop doing that.

191
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:25,250
So let's just call it break to break out
of that for loop.

192
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:31,540
And I think that should do the trick, so
let's

193
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:35,820
run it and I'll take the cross just for
variety.

194
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,650
And now we've successfully cancelled it.

195
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:46,460
So, and the basic message is you can't
cancel on your worker thread and use

196
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:50,960
is cancelled within your processing and
doing background

197
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:54,010
to check whether the thread has been
canceled.

198
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:57,870
And if it is, you, it's up to you to then
stop doing processing

199
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:59,350
because string isn't going to barge in

200
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:02,490
there and, like physically terminate the
thread.

201
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,440
All it's gonna do is set that flag
basically.

202
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:07,830
And if you've gotten the thread.sleep or
if you've got a

203
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:11,670
wait in there then that's going to throw
an interrupted exception

204
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:14,260
and that's just something to be aware of
because you might

205
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:18,860
want to have your interrupt exceptions
just handled silently or you.

206
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:22,750
You might wanna handle 'em somehow by
cancelling further processing.

207
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:23,430
I don't know.

208
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:27,290
So, that's it for this tutorial.

209
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:28,280
Join me again next time.

210
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,535
And until next time, happy coding.

211
