00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:04,332
Hello, this is John from
caveofprogramming.com.

2
00:00:04,332 --> 00:00:08,660
And in this tutorial, we're gonna look at
tree icons and changing them.

3
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:10,730
So I've got this tree here, and there are

4
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:14,380
actually three kinds of icon, icons on
this tree.

5
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:18,638
There are the icons that represent open
nodes, like this one.

6
00:00:18,638 --> 00:00:21,011
And the icons that represent closed nodes
like this

7
00:00:21,011 --> 00:00:23,990
one, which are actually the same in this
tree.

8
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:28,120
And there are the icons that represent
leaves, like these paper icons here.

9
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,890
And I'm gonna change all of those.

10
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:35,150
So I'm gonna look at, I'm gonna use the
graphics from the Java

11
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:40,770
look and feel Sun graphics repository jar
that we've used previously for tool bar.

12
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:44,640
And I've unset that here and I'm gonna use
these three components.

13
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,440
I'm gonna use Server 16 for the leaf,
because my

14
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,090
notes are supposed to set kind of a
message service here.

15
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:55,680
And I'll use the web component, add 16.gif
with a plus sign on

16
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,290
it for the closed modes and the web
components 16 for the open modes.

17
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,860
So let's select those, and let's drag
them.

18
00:01:05,252 --> 00:01:07,460
Crtl + Select.

19
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:10,330
Let's drag them into my images package
now.

20
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,559
And now to load these images, I'm gonna
use a

21
00:01:14,559 --> 00:01:20,400
little convenience message, method, that I
created for my toolbar here.

22
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,890
Because the toolbar has got a great image
icon.

23
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:31,910
And that just, gets results and loads the
image, and return to URL.

24
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:35,770
And then up at this error message that the
URL is null.

25
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:38,130
Which is really the main purpose of this,
rather

26
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:40,830
than doing it all in one line, as I could.

27
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:44,960
And then it creates an image icon with
that URL which just returns the icon.

28
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,970
And I'm just gonna cut that from there,
from the toolbar class,

29
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:52,360
and I'm gonna go to my utils class where I
implemented this.

30
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,630
Get file extension.

31
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:54,860
That's a paste in there.

32
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:59,020
I'm gonna make it public static, and then
since we can't

33
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:03,960
do get class, and static method, I'm just
going to do systems.getClass.

34
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,290
That'll do the trick, or it should do
anyway.

35
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:09,200
System.getClass.

36
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:09,910
Let's have a look,

37
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:21,230
that should be fine, let's try
system.getResults.

38
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:23,661
Actually I don't, I don't know why
system.getClass wouldn't work.

39
00:02:23,661 --> 00:02:32,340
Let's try system.getClass, system.class,
let's try system.class.

40
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,330
Work this out in the end.

41
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:35,130
All we need is a reference to a class.

42
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,890
that, yeah, there we go.

43
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:43,698
So, this does the trick,
system.class.getResults.

44
00:02:43,698 --> 00:02:50,560
GetResults is a method of the class,
class, so I just needed a class there.

45
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,530
I suppose I could use image icon.class,
but it

46
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:56,500
doesn't matter, okay, let's leave that,
that does the trick.

47
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,429
And if I run this.

48
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:01,790
after, yeah, this change the toolbar now,
to use that method.

49
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:06,300
So I need to go to, instead of saying just

50
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:12,890
create icons now utils and create icon,
and utils.create icon.

51
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:14,042
Lets just run that.

52
00:03:14,042 --> 00:03:16,770
To check that I've haven't got anything
screwed up.

53
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:19,970
And so I've still got icons on the
toolbar, so that's good.

54
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:25,888
And now in my message panel, where I
create that tree.

55
00:03:25,888 --> 00:03:34,241
I'm gonna, on the tree, I, I'm gonna
first, create a private,

56
00:03:34,241 --> 00:03:41,460
default tree cell renderer,
DefaultTreeCellRenderer.

57
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:47,390
And I'll call that treeRenderer, let's
call that.

58
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:49,810
It's actually treeCellRenderer I suppose
strictly speaking.

59
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,880
And here before I create the

60
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:58,520
tree, I say treeRenderer equals new
DefaultTreeCellRenderer.

61
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:04,180
And the advantage of doing that is later
on I can say

62
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:10,761
serverTree, after I've created the
j-tree.set CellRenderor.

63
00:04:10,761 --> 00:04:14,213
Here we go, and I can set that to my
treeRenderor, and a

64
00:04:14,213 --> 00:04:19,560
tree, the tree cell rederor, actually I
think I will call this treeCellRenderor.

65
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,453
Because it's confusing calling it a tree

66
00:04:21,453 --> 00:04:24,160
renderor when it's really a tree cell
renderor.

67
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,688
The treeCellRenderer, the
DefaultTreeCellRenderer is what

68
00:04:27,688 --> 00:04:30,380
normally renders your tree nodes and
leaves.

69
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:35,320
So if I run that, it's not gonna be any
different from before, hopefully.

70
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,420
There we go.

71
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:39,510
But now what I can do is I can say

72
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:44,957
I can say I can set the icons using my
treeCellRenderer.

73
00:04:44,957 --> 00:04:51,725
So I say treeCellRenderer, and let's do,
for starts, set,

74
00:04:51,725 --> 00:04:58,550
and, whoops, setLeafIcon, and then I can
use my utils.

75
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:03,671
Get.CreateIcon and pass in the path there.

76
00:05:03,671 --> 00:05:08,436
Which is gonna be /images/ and as long as
these images are somewhere

77
00:05:08,436 --> 00:05:12,638
on the class path and in images sub
folder, is gonna be good.

78
00:05:12,638 --> 00:05:21,230
And I set that to server16.gif, then we'll
run that, we'll take a look at it.

79
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:28,180
So, now in my tree, I've got this server
icon, which is rather nice.

80
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:37,046
And I can also say treeCellRenderer.set,
OpenIcon.

81
00:05:37,046 --> 00:05:40,550
And for that I'm gonna use it's gonna look
almost

82
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:44,900
the same as this actually, let's just copy
that line there.

83
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:53,072
And I'm going to set that to,
webComponent16.gif,

84
00:05:53,072 --> 00:05:59,822
so, let's make that webComponent16.gif.

85
00:05:59,822 --> 00:06:02,760
And if I run that, let's check that that
works.

86
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,160
So, there we go, that's rather nice.

87
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:12,156
and, I'm also going to, so this
represents, opened

88
00:06:12,156 --> 00:06:16,790
kinda node and closed nodes is still like
that.

89
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:21,250
And I'm also gonna set the close nodes, as
well, so now I command those.

90
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:26,630
Let's say setCloseIcon, setCloseIcon.

91
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,460
There we go, get into that bracket.

92
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:36,450
And, on this set up to
webComponentadd16.gif,

93
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:42,202
and if I run that now with a bit of luck,
and go to my tree and there we are.

94
00:06:42,202 --> 00:06:44,860
Can expand these nodes and here are my
servers.

95
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:52,002
And now in the next tutorial we're gonna
be customizing these leaves completely.

96
00:06:52,002 --> 00:06:56,290
So instead of having like the server icons
there, though they do look rather nice.

97
00:06:56,290 --> 00:07:02,130
We're gonna look at how you can make those
look how you can use your own component.

98
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:08,135
And and finally this is gonna be step
towards having our own editors in there.

99
00:07:08,135 --> 00:07:12,240
So that we can tick and untick these
components.

100
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:17,360
So next tutorial we'll change these leaves

101
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,810
to be rendered by a completely custom
component.

102
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:24,055
So join me again then and until next time,
happy coding.

103
00:07:24,055 --> 00:07:24,327
