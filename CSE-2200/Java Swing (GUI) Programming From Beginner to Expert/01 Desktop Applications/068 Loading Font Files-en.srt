00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:05,180
Hello, this is John from
caveofprogramming.com and

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:07,600
in this tutorial, we're going to look

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:14,360
at loading particular font files so you
can set the exact font that you want.

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:19,130
Now, let's just run the application and
I'm gonna set

5
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:24,000
the font this time on the headers of these
messages.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,010
So I'm gonna change the font on, this is
actually a jLabel.

7
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:31,100
And I'm gonna change the font on that.

8
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:37,540
So I've downloaded a font file and I have
it in this folder somewhere.

9
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:45,260
Let's see, somewhere I've got, I found on
the Internet this CrimewaveBB.ttf.

10
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:49,040
So I'm gonna copy that and that's a font
file of course.

11
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:53,230
And, in my project I'm gonna make a new
package.

12
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:55,790
I'm gonna say, new package.

13
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:58,250
And I'm gonna call that fonts.

14
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:02,770
And I'm gonna paste my font file into
there.

15
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:03,410
So now it's there.

16
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:12,920
And now in my GUIutils.java, in here I've
actually got a message for loading icons.

17
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,150
I'm gonna just copy that message.

18
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,570
So, copy that method.

19
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:19,320
Sorry, although some people call them
messages.

20
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,240
And I'm gonna change this so it can load
the font file.

21
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:28,570
So I'll say create font instead of create
icon, and

22
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:32,440
that's gonna return a font and it's gonna
take a path.

23
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:37,490
And it's gonna return, it's gonna be a
system.class get resource.

24
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:39,030
And that returns the URL.

25
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:44,430
And then if the URL is null, we'll say
unable to load font, and say what the path

26
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:50,370
was, and then if that goes well, I'm gonna
say font.

27
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:55,300
Font equals, instead of doing new image
icon here.

28
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:58,460
I'm gonna say, let's let the font class.

29
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:59,360
You know?

30
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,760
Let's say font.createfont.

31
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:09,130
And the first argument here is a static,
integer, variable from the font class.

32
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:13,790
And it can be either true type font, or
type 1 font.

33
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:17,370
And since I've got Chrome, [UNKNOWN] .ttf,
in other words,

34
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,985
true type font, I'm gonna set that to true
type font.

35
00:02:20,985 --> 00:02:26,380
And the second argument here is it's gonna
be the actual

36
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:31,560
font that you wanna that you wanna sorry,
the second argument here, lost my

37
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,669
train of thoughts there for a second, is
gonna be a stream.

38
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:43,630
On this font file, an input stream that
can stream this font file.

39
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,810
And to get that input stream we just have
to say URL.

40
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:49,705
Dot let's get focused there.

41
00:02:49,705 --> 00:02:57,880
URL.openstream, so the URL points not to
the internet but to this font file.

42
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:01,280
Because that's the path that we're gonna
put in, we just need to open

43
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:06,620
stream to get an input stream from this
URL and that will load the font.

44
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:11,598
okay, so.

45
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:18,970
And after that actually, I could say
URL.closestream.

46
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:21,240
URL dot where are we.

47
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:24,450
I'm pretty sure there's a closeStream
method.

48
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,600
Okay, maybe I imagined that.

49
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,870
So I won't worry about that.

50
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,320
And let's just return to font then in that
case.

51
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,080
I don't know why I thought there was a
closeStream method.

52
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,120
Okay, so here.

53
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,298
I need to say return font, so I'm gonna
say return font.

54
00:03:46,298 --> 00:03:50,830
Format thing there, somehow I've messed up

55
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:54,470
these brackets, so let's let's take a
look.

56
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:57,220
So we load the font with create font and
then I

57
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:02,410
wanna say return font, and oh yeah, put
semi colon in.

58
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:05,050
And I think we're now in business.

59
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:09,206
We've also got to handle the exceptions
that can arise when you call create font.

60
00:04:09,206 --> 00:04:18,490
So we're gonna do surround with tri catch
there, and I'm gonna say here.

61
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:24,870
So, it will throw a font format exception
if you if you can't

62
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,560
if, if their font file has the wrong
format altogether.

63
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:37,160
So in that case, let's just say sys, sys
err, font, well, if

64
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:42,692
that adds the formats in font file,
that'll do, plus path.

65
00:04:42,692 --> 00:04:45,570
And here.

66
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:47,800
If there's an IO exception, probably it
just can't read

67
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,330
the file because of, I don't know
permissions or something.

68
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:58,880
And let's say, Unable to read font file,
and plus path.

69
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:04,650
Okay we're almost there and now, I'm gonna
have to set this to no, because

70
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:13,530
there's the error here is that it's, this
variable could be uninitialized because,

71
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:17,240
if you can't, you know, if, if this throws
an exception, the font's not

72
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:21,250
gonna get set to anything, and you've got
to initialize your variables in Java.

73
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,140
So, so that equal to null.

74
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,480
So, this returns null if it can't load the
font.

75
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,450
And now I'm gonna go to my message panel

76
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:35,010
now and there is a little complication
still to come.

77
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:38,465
So let's look for, actually, yeah, it's
the

78
00:05:38,465 --> 00:05:44,310
message, this renderer actually renders
those message titles.

79
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,820
And we've got this label here.

80
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,010
And I need to set the font on that label.

81
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:52,870
So, I'm gonna say here in the constructor
message this renderer, Label.setFont,

82
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:56,980
So it has a setFont method just like jText
area, for example.

83
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:03,794
And then I'm gonna say, util.createFont,

84
00:06:03,794 --> 00:06:08,800
and I'm gonna pass in a path, /fonts/

85
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:14,140
and my font's called crimewavebb.ttf.

86
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,040
And now that's, that won't work in itself.

87
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:20,368
Because if I run that it's just gonna look
invisible and

88
00:06:20,368 --> 00:06:25,890
the reason is that the reason is that
where are we, utils.

89
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:29,420
So when you do create font, this returns a
font

90
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:33,160
with a size of one point, which is
basically invisible.

91
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:39,570
And to get, to get this to work, once you
return to font so this returns a

92
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:46,380
font, I need to then call the dot derive
method of the font class.

93
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:51,660
And I'm gonna use the method that takes
style and a size.

94
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:54,280
You'll notice some different methods for
style and size here.

95
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,694
But I've found that if you don't set the
style then it

96
00:06:56,694 --> 00:07:00,350
still seems to be invisible for reasons
that I don't fully understand.

97
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:03,670
So I'm gonna use this method here that
sets the style and the size.

98
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:07,416
Now the style is just font dot plain bold
or italic.

99
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:10,660
Let's try making it bold.

100
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,010
See what that looks like.

101
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:14,050
Font dot bold.

102
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:19,750
And I'll do control to go to add the font
class.

103
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:23,220
And then, I want to, I'm gonna use the
rest of this

104
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:26,540
method that then just takes the font size
for the next document.

105
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:30,000
So let's try setting that to, I don't
know, 22.

106
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,220
See how that looks.

107
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:39,120
And so that should do the trick and I'll
do control > shift > F there to format it.

108
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,080
And let's run that.

109
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,710
So basically you return the font using
your url, input screen.

110
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:48,310
And you call derive font to create the
derive font, font

111
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:51,230
from the initial font, which will be the
font you actually use.

112
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:54,370
So I'll run that.

113
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:56,900
Now if I look at my message headers,

114
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,620
they're in bold and they're in this
crimewavebb.ttf.

115
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:03,840
Actually, I'm going to try to plain that,
because I

116
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,180
think it would look better and probably 20
is enough really.

117
00:08:08,975 --> 00:08:12,020
Okay, so that's it for this tutorial.

118
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:16,011
Join me again next time and until then,
happy coding.

119
