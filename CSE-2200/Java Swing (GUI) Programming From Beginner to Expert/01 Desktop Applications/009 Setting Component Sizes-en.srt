[SOUND] Hello again, this is John

2
00:00:02,595 --> 00:00:07,497
from caveofprogramming.com, and in this
tutorial we're

3
00:00:07,497 --> 00:00:13,853
gonna look at sizing components, so in our
last tutorial I created this.

4
00:00:13,853 --> 00:00:17,306
And what I'm gonna do with this
application is,

5
00:00:17,306 --> 00:00:20,067
I'm gonna let a panel on the left, which
is

6
00:00:20,067 --> 00:00:23,519
gonna be a form, so it's gonna contain
some text

7
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,010
fields for entering data and a button to
submit data.

8
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:32,090
So an, in the context of that, I'm gonna
show

9
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:37,140
you, I'm gonna explain a bit about sizing
things in swing.

10
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:44,432
So, to start with I'm gonna add a new
class in here, which I will, which once

11
00:00:44,432 --> 00:00:51,640
again, is gonna expand JPanel, and I'm
gonna, I'm gonna call it form panel.

12
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:57,093
And it's gonna, actually I'll just click
finish that.

13
00:00:57,093 --> 00:01:04,708
And by hand I'll type extends j panel just
for variation.

14
00:01:04,708 --> 00:01:09,740
So this is a kind of j panel and I'm gonna
give it a constructor.

15
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:17,548
So form panel, [SOUND] and I'm gonna add
this to the main frame.

16
00:01:17,548 --> 00:01:18,934
So it goes to the main frame.

17
00:01:18,934 --> 00:01:23,524
Okay, let private [SOUND] form, form, if I
can

18
00:01:23,524 --> 00:01:28,601
get it cut to left there, form panel, form
panel.

19
00:01:28,601 --> 00:01:36,040
And let's say form panel equals, equals
new form panel.

20
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:43,895
And I'm gonna add that on the left-hand
side, so, in the west location, so add

21
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:50,565
form panel borderlayout.west.

22
00:01:50,565 --> 00:01:51,805
Now if I run this

23
00:01:54,295 --> 00:02:00,295
so I need to select this App here it's
added the panel

24
00:02:00,295 --> 00:02:04,050
but it's it's very narrow, and I want that
panel to be wider.

25
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:09,840
Now with some components under some
circumstances, for example main frame

26
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:17,060
you can just do set size but usually what
happens is, you're adding a component.

27
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:19,110
Using a layout manager.

28
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:23,360
And it's actually the layout manager that
determines the size of the component.

29
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:31,380
And in order to tell the layout managers
what size and the components want

30
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:36,880
to be, the components have anything called
a preferred size.

31
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:41,370
So to show you if I go to this form panel.

32
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:46,130
Now, preferred size is actually there's

33
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:48,180
actually a method called get preferred
size.

34
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:52,530
And that returns a object called
dimension.

35
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:54,790
So I'll call it dimension dim.

36
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:56,070
And I'll say equals

37
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:03,110
get preferred size, get preferred size.

38
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:10,710
And if I do [UNKNOWN] on dim I'm not too
sure if dimension has a two stream method.

39
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:11,840
Yeah, it does.

40
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,461
Okay, so we can see that the preferred
size of

41
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:18,920
this panel is ten units wide and ten units
high.

42
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:25,025
Nevertheless, it's actually spanning the
entire vertical height here.

43
00:03:25,025 --> 00:03:31,310
And the reason for that is, although the
component can have a preferred size.

44
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:33,360
The layout manager will not necessarily
respect

45
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,030
it and some layout managers ignore it
completely.

46
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:44,930
But for border layout here it's gonna use
it judiciously.

47
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:51,070
So what I can do here to resize the panel
is I can say dim.set in fact, I

48
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:56,480
can say dim.width and change the width to
let's say 250 pixels.

49
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:03,070
And I can call setPreferredSize,
setPreferredSize, dim.

50
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,510
Like this.

51
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:07,100
So I've got the preferred size.

52
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,240
And I set the width to 50.

53
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,490
And then I've called setPreferredSize.

54
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:14,670
And here I could've just done, new

55
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:17,890
dimension, and, and given it some dummy,
height.

56
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:21,900
Because, as we can see, the border layout
manager is

57
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,890
not respect the height anyway but it will
respect the width.

58
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:31,560
So if I run this we've got now a wider
panel that's easier to add controls into.

59
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:38,370
And, and I think if I remember rightly,

60
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:42,940
that preferred size will also work with
buttons.

61
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:48,320
In the Gridbag layout manager because
shortly

62
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,710
in a couple of tutorials, we're gonna look

63
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:53,990
at how you use a layout manager called

64
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:56,120
Gridbag layout to add controls onto the
form.

65
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,080
But that's coming shortly.

66
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:04,120
So in the next tutorial we're gonna give
the form a nice looking border.

67
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:04,790
So join me again then.

68
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:06,901
And until then, happy coding.

69
00:05:06,901 --> 00:05:07,410
