00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:05,540
Hello, this is John from
Caveofprogramming.com, and this is

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:09,890
a tutorial on file chooser dialogs in Java
swing.

3
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:14,770
So at the moment, I've got this
application, and I've got this File menu.

4
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:17,650
And I can go to Export Data and Import
Data.

5
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:18,650
And I wanna make that.

6
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:21,580
Bring up File, choose a dialogue.

7
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:25,520
So I can choose to Open a file, or to Save
it.

8
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,240
And we're gonna look at that in this
tutorial.

9
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,250
So the first step is I wanna reuse the
same file chooser dialogue

10
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:39,290
every time because I wanna customize that
dialogue, and I wanna use it for both.

11
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:44,360
To my open and save files operations, file
operations.

12
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,220
And I also, wanted to remember where I
browsed

13
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,030
to the last time I opened it and for that

14
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:51,710
reason I'm gonna just use one file to use

15
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:54,620
the dialogue rather than create a new one
every time.

16
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:57,005
So here in my main frame I'm gonna

17
00:00:57,005 --> 00:01:01,185
create a private JFileChooser and I'm
gonna call that.

18
00:01:01,185 --> 00:01:03,950
FileChooser and add the import there.

19
00:01:05,446 --> 00:01:09,590
And let's maximize [UNKNOWN] control them.

20
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:12,672
And now here in the constructor mainframe
I'll

21
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:16,530
create a new FileChooser object equals new
JFileChooser.

22
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,700
And I'll go down here.

23
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:27,590
Scroll down to our create the menu, and I
want to add a couple of action listeners

24
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:34,177
on my menu items so I'll say
ImportDataItem.addActionListener.

25
00:01:35,956 --> 00:01:39,240
And this ImportDataItem is just the j menu
item,

26
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:44,040
you might remember from previous episodes
in this tutorial series.

27
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,850
So, I'm gonna add the ActionListener here.

28
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:49,325
And let's add the action perform method at
the

29
00:01:49,325 --> 00:01:53,370
ActionListener as we have done so many
times before now.

30
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:59,557
And in here, to start with I'm just gonna

31
00:01:59,557 --> 00:02:04,610
say FileChooser.showOpen,Open Dialog.

32
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:11,360
And for the parent window I'll parse in
mainframe.this, so that it knows

33
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,540
where its parent window is and it knows
where to appear and that sort of thing.

34
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,580
So now if I run that, that's already gonna
work.

35
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,430
File Import Data like this.

36
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,020
I can select.

37
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:21,870
I can Cancel it.

38
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,070
Or I can select files.

39
00:02:24,282 --> 00:02:27,580
But to actually get the file that's
chosen.

40
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:33,455
One thing you wanna check whether this
Open Dialog returns an a value that

41
00:02:33,455 --> 00:02:35,985
means that the user's clicked the confirm

42
00:02:35,985 --> 00:02:40,260
button, the Open button rather than
clicking Cancel.

43
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:47,055
So let's say if, let's wrap this in an if
and say if the return value of that is

44
00:02:47,055 --> 00:02:55,090
JFileChooser.APPROVE_OPTION, then, we're
gonna really open the file.

45
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:56,840
Otherwise we'll just ignore it.

46
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,800
And for the moment, I'll just do a sys out
cuz

47
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,670
I just wanna print the name of the file
for the moment.

48
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:07,620
And I'll say FileChooser.getSelectedFile.

49
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,840
And so I'm relying on the two string
method of, this

50
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,080
actually returns a file object, but if I
do sys out on

51
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,410
there, it's just gonna do a, I'm just
gonna see the

52
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:20,079
path, cuz it will just invoke the two
string method of file.

53
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:23,360
So now let's run that and see how it
looks.

54
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,510
So I do File Import Data.

55
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:28,460
And let's pick a file here.

56
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,570
well, you can see that I can browse
between different directories.

57
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:38,620
Now let's pick this file and go to Open
and here I've got the name of the

58
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,960
file and it's returning the file object
that actually

59
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,780
represents the file so I could open this
now.

60
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:47,930
And in future tutorials so, we haven't
actually got a data model

61
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:52,839
for this application at the moment, what
I'm doing really is all kind of view.

62
00:03:54,860 --> 00:04:00,640
So in a future tutorial soon we're gonna
look at creating a simple data model.

63
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,090
And when we've got the data model, we can
then look at saving that data.

64
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,290
But for the moment we're just gonna
concentrate on getting the app.

65
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:13,790
The actual files to save to or open And
for my

66
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:18,900
Export Data item I'll add a very similar
listener, so let's just change this

67
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:23,680
to Export, since this is the export data
item, instead of show open

68
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:29,610
dialog, quite simply I'm gonna change this
to show Save Dialog, like that.

69
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:35,400
And if I run this now and do Export Data.

70
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,420
This brings up the Save Dialog that says
Save.

71
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:42,520
And, if I choose file, and then it's gonna
output the

72
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:46,580
name of the file that I chose here because
it's doing this.

73
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,830
So that's, that's enough for this
tutorial, I think.

74
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:53,830
And in the next tutorial, we're gonna
refine this.

75
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:58,830
File dialog a little bit because we're
gonna actually, if you, you see

76
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:02,460
in the moment you can choose any file, but
in the next tutorial

77
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:05,120
we're gonna look at how you add filters to
the file so that

78
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,620
you can, narrow this down to particular
kinds of files with particular extensions.

79
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:17,450
And in closing I just wanna point out a
really useful resource here, if you

80
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:22,720
go to Google, and I've mentioned this Also
in the first tutorial.

81
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,510
And you search for swing visual guides
components.

82
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:30,340
This is re, a really really useful page.

83
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:33,950
So click on the first entry there, and if
you search in there

84
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:39,950
for FileChooser, you can see extensive
examples on how to use a FileChooser.

85
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,600
And one thing that it talks about here
that

86
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,040
I'm not gonna show you in these tutorials
is you

87
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,070
can actually create little custom panels,
which show like

88
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:50,350
a custom view of the files that you're
looking at.

89
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,190
And there's also some really useful code I

90
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:58,840
think if you search for Utils.Java in
there.

91
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:02,750
Then there's actually a they actually give
you a little

92
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:07,240
utils class here that gets the extension
from a file name.

93
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,128
But we're gonna, I'm gonna implement my
own for these tutorials.

94
00:06:10,128 --> 00:06:13,980
But that's, and you can easily figure that
out.

95
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:16,030
It's just kind of string handling stuff.

96
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:17,400
But this is, this is quite handy.

97
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:21,600
So that's it for this tutorial.

98
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,070
In the next tutorial, as I say we'll look
at filtering this file.

99
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:26,730
So join me again then.

100
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:29,060
And until next time, happy coding.
