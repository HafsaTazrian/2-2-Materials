1
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:05,340
Now this this isn't really a tutorial.

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,840
It's really more just mentioning something
that I

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,400
forgot to do earlier, to tell the truth.

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,551
Which is that this connection preferences
dialogue

5
00:00:14,551 --> 00:00:17,610
from [UNKNOWN] point view is all fine, but

6
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:19,670
I forgot to actually make you configure
the

7
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:23,080
database connection, so it wasn't actually
doing anything.

8
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:26,800
and, and, so I just implemented that and I
am not going to get through

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,250
it in detail, because there is no new
swing concepts and and it would be boring.

10
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:37,040
But basically I given an database switch
over some private instance variables,

11
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,920
and I've given it a connect method which
also disconnects if it's

12
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,070
already connected and then reconnects and
I've wrapped that in a inject

13
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:51,550
messaging controller, and then in the main
frame in the GUI package here.

14
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:59,050
I've basically made it so that the prefs
dialogue let's go down here.

15
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:03,080
When that's closed, it reconfigures the
connection.

16
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,630
So, that's it for now.

17
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:06,490
Just something that I've got to do
basically.

18
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:12,770
Oh yeah, and also when the application
starts up somewhere up here I've

19
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:17,270
made it so that it loads the, oh yeah,
here, it loads the defaults.

20
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:22,040
And configures the configures the actual
database

21
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,330
connection was previously just loading the
default

22
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:27,260
so much, from doing anything with them
apart from pulling them in the dialog.

23
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:29,220
So that's it for now.

24
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,570
And until next time, happy coding.
