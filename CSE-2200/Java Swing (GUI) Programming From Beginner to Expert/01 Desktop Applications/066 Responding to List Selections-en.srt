00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:03,650
Hi, welcome back, in this tutorial we're

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:07,286
gonna look at responding to selections in
JList.

3
00:00:07,286 --> 00:00:12,560
So in the moment if I run this
application, here in this

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:16,969
panel here, I've got a JList list which
I've added objects to.

5
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:21,550
I have to type message and messages since
it's an object I created myself.

6
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:27,952
And because you could just add strings to
a JList but either way sometimes you want

7
00:00:27,952 --> 00:00:33,960
actually respond when the user selects a
different item.

8
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,270
So often what you want to do is you want
to have a button like here

9
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,790
and you just get the selection when the

10
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,450
user clicks the button and we've covered
that before.

11
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:45,310
But what I'm gonna show you in this
tutorial is, how

12
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:48,725
to actually detect when an item is
selected in a JList.

13
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,055
So, let's go to the message panel and

14
00:00:54,055 --> 00:00:59,060
I'll search for the message list, JList in
here.

15
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,440
And here it is.

16
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:10,769
And I'm gonna say,
messageList.addListSelectionListener.

17
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:20,691
And, I'll add a new ListSelectionListener

18
00:01:20,691 --> 00:01:24,180
and I'm going to add do Ctrl+Shift+O to
add the import there.

19
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:31,210
Doesn't seem to have worked, I've got a
extra bracket there.

20
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:32,950
Okay, Ctrl+Shift+O, etcetera.

21
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:36,630
Put the bracket in the right place and I'm
going

22
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:39,690
to add the unimplemented method it just
the value change method.

23
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:44,380
And this is called whenever someone clicks
an item on the list.

24
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:48,430
And all I'm going to do here is I'm going
to get the selection from the list but

25
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:51,040
I'm going to get the selected object in
the

26
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,890
list, which if you know these strings will
be strings.

27
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:59,432
Well I've added message objects to

28
00:01:59,432 --> 00:02:05,339
the, o the list, so if I say message,

29
00:02:05,339 --> 00:02:10,142
message equals messageList,

30
00:02:10,142 --> 00:02:16,425
messageList.get, getSelectedValue

31
00:02:16,425 --> 00:02:21,210
rather than getSelected.

32
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:23,730
So we've seen it get to that index before
and that

33
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:26,980
get's you the index starting at zero with
the selected item.

34
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:31,280
If you say getSelectedValue it returns an
object of

35
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,090
whatever kind of thing you added to the
list.

36
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,340
If you added strings, you get strings.

37
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:40,540
I added these message objects that I
created so I'm gonna get message objects.

38
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:44,200
So, I'm gonna [UNKNOWN] a message.

39
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,480
Saying string, so I'm typing string.

40
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,100
And now I can say, I can get the text to
that message.

41
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:51,820
And what I wanna do is

42
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:59,162
I wanna say, textPane, textPanel.setText
and message.getContents.

43
00:02:59,162 --> 00:03:03,680
Actually the problem with this is I
haven't actually

44
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,030
to define the set text in my message
panel.

45
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:09,650
So let's go to a text panel, sorry.

46
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:13,534
So let's go to the text panel here

47
00:03:13,534 --> 00:03:19,510
and give it a public void setText(String
Text).

48
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:21,490
And this is just gonna wrap the

49
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:24,760
corresponding method in the underline text
area.

50
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:29,940
So I could really have just use a text
area directly in this lower panel.

51
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:35,170
So let's say set text, text.

52
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,120
Here we go, text.

53
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:44,110
And now when I run this program, I'm going
to get, if I select

54
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:47,500
an item on the list, the text will appear
in the panel down here.

55
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,360
And I'm going to make one little tweak
here which is I'm

56
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,748
gong to go to the message panel and let's
find the retrieveMessages method.

57
00:03:55,748 --> 00:03:58,126
RetrieveMessages.

58
00:03:58,126 --> 00:04:03,550
So, it sets, retrieve messages sets the
items in the list right here.

59
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:07,555
And I just want to say, after we

60
00:04:07,555 --> 00:04:11,871
finish adding items, let's say

61
00:04:11,871 --> 00:04:19,130
messageList.setSelectedIndex and let's say
zero.

62
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:21,382
So hopefully.

63
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:26,060
Now if we get like a default, we get like
the

64
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:31,700
first item selected and we like the full
text appearing down here.

65
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:37,160
Although the selection isn't showing which
may be a little bug in my application.

66
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,650
But that's okay because actually I don't
think it's

67
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:42,922
the same with Outlook but it wouldn't
surprise me.

68
00:04:42,922 --> 00:04:48,520
So let's, let's also I'm just gonna do one
little thing that's not actually connected

69
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:53,950
to this at all but I just think might be
text in this text panel down here.

70
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:56,520
It looks a little bit like it's too close
to the border.

71
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,950
For that, I'm just going to go to my text
panel.

72
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:05,530
I'm going to say, here, text, text,

73
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:09,997
area, text area, area.setBorder

74
00:05:09,997 --> 00:05:13,935
and I'm going to set the border to a

75
00:05:13,935 --> 00:05:20,960
BorderFactory.createEmptyBorder.

76
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,420
Let's set the import and create empty
border and

77
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:27,300
I'll use the right, that type of anti
border

78
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,230
that takes arguments and I'm just gonna
put like

79
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:33,880
a 5 pixel, anti border around the text
area.

80
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:41,120
So if we look at that now the text is a
little bit indented, well

81
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,620
it's a little bit not quiet as flush to
the edge as it was before which is good.

82
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:49,250
So I'll leave it there for this tutorial
and join me again next.

83
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:52,103
Next time and until then, happy coding.

84
00:05:52,103 --> 00:05:55,129
