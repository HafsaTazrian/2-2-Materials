Hello this is John from
caveofprogramming.com, and this is a

2
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:12,190
tutorial on selecting rows in tables and
getting selected rows.

3
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:15,888
So it's actually possible to select
multiple rows in J

4
00:00:15,888 --> 00:00:19,970
tables, but we're not gonna look at that
in this tutorial.

5
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:24,700
We're just, in this tutorial, we're just
gonna look at selecting one table row.

6
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,300
And the idea is so I've got this
application here.

7
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,800
And I can import data into it.

8
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:34,440
And I've got this pop-up menu which
appears if I right click on the table.

9
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,390
And when I right click the table, I want
to

10
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:41,370
select the table row that's directly
underneath the mouse here.

11
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:48,840
So to do that I, in the last tutorial, I
added a mouse listener to my table.

12
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,340
And when I click the right mouse button.

13
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,090
Actually, when I select the relevant table
row.

14
00:00:56,090 --> 00:01:02,470
In fact we can make so that the table row
selected if the mouse is clicked at all.

15
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:08,580
And to do that I'm gonna use a method, a

16
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,380
table, that returns the row, that's at a
certain point.

17
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:16,150
So in mouse pressed.

18
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:20,900
Actually, in here i'm gonna say.

19
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:25,622
[UNKNOWN] row equals table.row.

20
00:01:25,622 --> 00:01:28,300
At point.

21
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:34,030
And row point, gives me the table row
that's a particular point.

22
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:38,074
And to get the point where the mouse is
at, I'm

23
00:01:38,074 --> 00:01:42,639
just gonna use the method of this mouse
and enter here

24
00:01:42,639 --> 00:01:48,447
and say, E.getpoint, like that and now to
show that works,

25
00:01:48,447 --> 00:01:52,539
I can just assist that out here [SOUND] on
my row.

26
00:01:52,539 --> 00:01:56,600
And if I run this, Sync later.

27
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,370
And, right click, you can see down here in

28
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:03,690
the console pane, that I'm getting a
number that

29
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:07,840
represents the row of the the row
underneath where

30
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,630
I clicked the mouse which is exactly what
I want.

31
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:17,040
Now to select that row I need to use these
selection model at the table.

32
00:02:18,328 --> 00:02:21,439
Because if I say table tops, I'll get

33
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:26,020
selection model, where are we, get
selection model.

34
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:31,040
That returns me a object that deals with
the selections on the table,

35
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:39,142
And I want to say getselectionmodel.select

36
00:02:39,142 --> 00:02:42,300
dot add set selection.

37
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:46,240
So, set selection interval, that's one.

38
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,800
So with set selection interval, you can
select rows in

39
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,110
your table starting at this row, finishing
at this row

40
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:56,885
and I'm just gonna select one row here, so
I

41
00:02:56,885 --> 00:03:00,595
just wanna start it, the row that's under
my mouse.

42
00:03:00,595 --> 00:03:02,575
So I'm finishing that row as well.

43
00:03:04,445 --> 00:03:06,405
So, if I run that now.

44
00:03:08,175 --> 00:03:15,265
And import some data, then we select the
row under the mouse which is very nice.

45
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:21,680
Now, the next step here, is when I select

46
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,990
this menu item, delete row, I wanna get
the selected row from the table so that

47
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:32,090
I can delete it, and to do that, I'm gonna
first add an

48
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:36,920
action listener, to write to my remove
item in my pop up menu.

49
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:41,220
So I'll say remove item but add action
listener.

50
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:45,840
Listener and, and new action listener.

51
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,650
I'll use then anonymous class in here
again.

52
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:55,170
And put the brackets in the, and it's at
the import.

53
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:59,120
And if I click on this error, I can go to
at unimplementing methods.

54
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:06,590
Just maximize the editor here, and get rid
of some extra lines.

55
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:11,512
And now, I can say Int row equals

56
00:04:11,512 --> 00:04:16,870
table.getselectionmodel again, get

57
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:22,180
selection model and if I actually I could
just use get a

58
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:27,870
selected row in this case which will be
some place, and then to check as you just.

59
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:33,490
Sys out here, row and, now, so I got rid

60
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:36,900
of the other sys out, so now if I run
this-

61
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:41,260
in fact, let's minimize the editor and
show the console-

62
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:47,500
so if I run this, do control I, import
some data then I right click and go

63
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:53,000
to delete row, and presto in the console
down there, you can see that it's output.

64
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,700
Putting the selected row with the table.

65
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,460
Now in the next tutorial we're gonna look
at

66
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:03,730
deleting rows from this table, so join me
again then.

67
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:07,640
And, and until next time happy coding.
