Hello, this is John from caveofprogramming
.com, and

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:08,060
in this tutorial, we're gonna look at
tabbed panes.

3
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:12,190
So I'm actually gonna, change this
application so that instead

4
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:15,330
of just having a table here, we've got a
tabbed pane.

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:19,330
One tab's gonna have a table in it, and
the other tab's gonna have a very fancy

6
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:25,410
looking message reader that will well, it
won't actually do anything, but,

7
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:30,550
will can make it display messages from
retrieve from an imaginary server.

8
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:36,730
That gives us an opportunity to look at
some more interesting swing components.

9
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:38,720
So this tutorial we're just gonna do the
top pane bit,

10
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:44,370
and I'm gonna start by declaring a private
J [UNKNOWN] pane here.

11
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:49,555
We [UNKNOWN] pane, and right here, before
I create

12
00:00:49,555 --> 00:00:54,492
the split pane, I'm gonna set the type
pane to a

13
00:00:54,492 --> 00:00:59,552
new [UNKNOWN] pane, and I'm gonna add the
tab pane

14
00:00:59,552 --> 00:01:04,890
to the split pane instead of a table
panel.

15
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:07,680
So here I'll put tab pane instead of the
table panel.

16
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,210
And if I, if I run that in a moment we're

17
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:15,672
not gonna see anything interesting cuz
there's no tabs in it.

18
00:01:15,672 --> 00:01:18,860
But now I can add tabs to that tab pane.

19
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:21,246
So, let's go ahead and do that.

20
00:01:21,246 --> 00:01:29,560
The first type I'm gonna add, I'm gonna
say type, tab pane dot add tab.

21
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:34,880
And, you can give each tab a title, and a
component to display actually in the tab.

22
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,840
You can also, if you want specify an icon
for

23
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,570
the tab as well, but we won't do that
here.

24
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:42,270
I'll just use this form in the
constructor.

25
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:49,837
So I'll say here person database a dot
being my first

26
00:01:49,837 --> 00:01:55,530
my first tab, and in there I'll put table
panel.

27
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:02,997
And then I'll have another tab pane here,
another tab, add tab and,

28
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:08,680
and I'll call this messages, [SOUND] and
in there I'll just use the

29
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:13,794
text panel for the moment, I I had an
earlier version of this

30
00:02:13,794 --> 00:02:20,083
application, and [INAUDIBLE] put it in the
right place so we get messages.

31
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:26,144
And something else that's worth mentioning
here is you can also

32
00:02:26,144 --> 00:02:32,560
set a custom component by saying, see top
pane set tab component.

33
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,800
And you supply an index.

34
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,110
The index is a zero based then you can

35
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:39,350
set a component that actually appears on
the tab.

36
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:42,390
Like, for example, you can implement your,
own close button.

37
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:43,540
But, I'm not gonna do that here.

38
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,500
I'm just gonna have very simple, plain
tabs.

39
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,690
So if I run that now, I've got two tabs.

40
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:51,420
The one tab has my personal database in
it, and.

41
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:56,100
And, the other tab I'm gonna turn this
into a sort of message panel.

42
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,770
And so that's it for this tutorial.

43
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:03,430
And in the next tutorial we are gonna look
at tree

44
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:08,135
controls, so join me again then and until
next time, happy coding.

45
00:03:08,135 --> 00:03:11,444
[SOUND]
