00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:05,450
Hello, this is John from
caveofprogramming.com, and in this

2
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:11,890
tutorial, we gonna look at saving data
with your application using preferences.

3
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:17,010
actually, at, at the end of the last
tutorial, I said properties.

4
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:21,300
And properties were kind of the old way of
doing this in Java.

5
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,869
And the new way, the preferred way is to
use preferences.

6
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,130
Now preferences aren't suitable for
storing large amounts of

7
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:35,832
data, like for example, the stuff in our
database here.

8
00:00:35,832 --> 00:00:40,400
But they are suitable for storing things
like the

9
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,810
little bits of data that you'd have in
this.

10
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:46,660
Dialogue or, for example the size and
location

11
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:50,356
of a window and that kind of thing.

12
00:00:50,356 --> 00:00:57,476
Now before I can save preferences in this
dialogue, I'm gonna add a

13
00:00:57,476 --> 00:01:04,620
event that will allow me to get the
information from the dialogue.

14
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:06,340
Back to my main frame.

15
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:10,530
And in the main frame I'm actually gonna
save the preferences.

16
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:15,470
So let's go to the let's go to the prefs
dialogue here.

17
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:20,140
And I'm gonna have a, some kind of

18
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,840
thing that can listen to that, and get
information.

19
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,570
From it.

20
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:26,990
Let's say let's create a new interface
here.

21
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:29,390
And I'll call it prefs listener.

22
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:38,880
And, I'll give prefs listener one method,
public void.

23
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:44,190
prefs, let's call it preferences set.

24
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:46,300
And that's gonna accept a

25
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:53,210
string user, string password.

26
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:59,292
And, a int, fault, number.

27
00:01:59,292 --> 00:02:04,340
So now, in my main frame, I

28
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:09,352
can say well, what, with a bit more work,
I'll be able to say

29
00:02:09,352 --> 00:02:15,012
prefs dialog.set.

30
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:21,060
Prefs listener and in

31
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:27,650
here, I will be able to say new prefs
listener and

32
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:32,180
just create an anonymous class using that
interface that I just defined by this.

33
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:38,090
So I can add the I need to create this,
method.

34
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:42,120
Set prefs listener my pref [UNKNOWN]
dialogue [UNKNOWN] for me.

35
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,152
There we go.

36
00:02:43,152 --> 00:02:46,773
and, I need to add the anonymous method
here in,

37
00:02:46,773 --> 00:02:51,090
it's very deep and that's the method here
in the mainframe.

38
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:53,480
So this is just stuff that I've done.

39
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,380
Several times before already in this
tutorial.

40
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:59,840
Just adding listeners and using them to
pass information to the main frame here.

41
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:09,130
And in my prefs dialogue here, so I'm
gonna save that, and I'm gonna have a

42
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:16,100
let's have a instant variable private
prefs listener.

43
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:22,250
So at the type of the interface I've just
defined prefs listener I'll call it.

44
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:26,290
And in the set method down here, I will
say,

45
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:33,580
so this this dot prefs listener, equals
prefs listener.

46
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:38,760
And now finally, the last step before I
actually deal with the properties

47
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:44,030
is that, when the OK button is clicked
here, I can

48
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:49,380
say, if prefs listener, is not equal

49
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:54,370
to null, in other words, has been set to
something, so there is actually

50
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:59,710
something listening I can say
prefslistener

51
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,030
dot, and call this preferences set.

52
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:06,470
And now I can parse in the user.

53
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:10,910
The password, which I'm gonna wrap in a
string.

54
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:13,090
So I'll say new string, password.

55
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:18,450
Because remember, password is an array of
chars, primitive chars.

56
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:22,640
And the port number let's call this port.

57
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:25,690
And, I can pass that in there.

58
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:33,512
Okay, so now, when I click OK in my dialog
it's gonna receive.

59
00:04:33,512 --> 00:04:38,130
This preferences set thing and I'm gonna
get this user and password

60
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:43,540
import if, if any values have been typed
for them of course.

61
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:50,910
So let's just output here the user, and
the password and check that this works.

62
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:59,370
So if I run this now, and go to the
preferences dialog, and type something

63
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:03,570
for user and something for password and
click Okay, it comes out in my main frame.

64
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:07,748
It's coming out twice, because I've also
get [UNKNOWN]

65
00:05:07,748 --> 00:05:10,100
out here in my prefs dialog so I remove
that.

66
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:17,640
And now the bit that you've been waiting
for, which is I'm gonna store def, the

67
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:21,290
kind of values that are typed into this
dialog between runs of this application.

68
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:27,300
So, first I'm gonna give this a public
void set defaults method and the

69
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:32,770
set defaults is gonna have String, String
user

70
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:38,590
and it's gonna have String password and

71
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:44,250
int port and what it's gonna do with
those.

72
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:49,160
Is, it's gonna say user field, dot set
text user,

73
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:56,044
and pass field dot set text, and

74
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:01,540
pass, so password actually.

75
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,940
So even though their password field
returns.

76
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:08,720
It let's you set it, set the password with
text.

77
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:16,332
And the port spinner here dot set five

78
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:23,800
and that's we're gonna pass in the portva
and you'll notice port is a.

79
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,230
Primitive integer.

80
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:31,640
But and set that to an actual object but
what would happen is, or I think it does.

81
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,450
What would happen is that Java will auto
box out

82
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:38,570
with an integer type and it will pass the
problem.

83
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:41,400
So, in my mainframe I can now set.

84
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,010
Defaults, if there are any defaults to be
set.

85
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:49,550
And to do that in my mainframe here.

86
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:52,230
I'm gonna give it a, private

87
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,340
object to type preferences.

88
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,760
Preferences.

89
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,699
Which I call prefs.

90
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:07,269
And down here, I'm gonna set prefs,

91
00:07:07,269 --> 00:07:14,220
equal to Preferences dot user Root.

92
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:20,380
And I need to create a Preferences node,
which is,

93
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:26,100
is basically just a kind of key that you
use to store your preferences objects.

94
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:26,810
I'll say node.

95
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:30,025
And often people use they say,

96
00:07:30,025 --> 00:07:33,700
getClass.getName in there, so their, the
name,

97
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,808
it would be the name of the class, the
main frame in this case.

98
00:07:36,808 --> 00:07:42,520
But here I think I'm just gonna do I'm
just gonna call it DB.

99
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,150
So it does, it doesn't really matter too
much what.

100
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:46,602
To what you're typing there.

101
00:07:46,602 --> 00:07:50,280
Just It should probably be some kind of
string with no spaces.

102
00:07:51,445 --> 00:07:58,230
Okay, and now that I've got my preferences
object, when the user

103
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:05,340
sets preferences here, I can say, prefs
dot part, and I can put.

104
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,640
Things with keys and values.

105
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:13,140
I'll say user and we'll call it well, well
add in there the user

106
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:18,560
name and prefs.put and let's add in,

107
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:26,330
password and source the password in there
and.

108
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:31,530
The port, let's say perhaps stop put,
port, and port.

109
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:37,700
So I'm just saving the values in a moment
later on, I'm gonna

110
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:43,900
actually I'm gonna actually do stuff with
them like set database can.

111
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:47,860
Details, actually, port this a prim, port
in a primitive integer, I'm gonna have to

112
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:55,720
wrap it, with a, non primitive integer,
port, and do to string on it.

113
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,110
So I'll actually be able to set it.

114
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,580
And now

115
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:07,700
I can, when, I run my main frame.

116
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:12,800
I can actually set set default values for
this dialog.

117
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:22,480
So, I can say here in the constructor main
frame still, press dialog.setdefaults.

118
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,814
Set defaults, there we go.

119
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:27,231
And that's the method that I added that
lets

120
00:09:27,231 --> 00:09:30,050
me just set the values, in my preferences
dialog.

121
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:32,500
Which okay, it's invisible, but it's still
there in

122
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,250
the background, so we can set defaults on
it.

123
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:37,820
And I can say yes.

124
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:41,970
So string user equals, and prefs dot get,
and

125
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:47,670
I just need to say user, just need to use
the same keys.

126
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:51,740
And I'll supply default, which would've
just been nothing here.

127
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:56,818
And since it's the default value, for if
there is no values

128
00:09:56,818 --> 00:10:01,485
stored in your preferences there and
string password

129
00:10:01,485 --> 00:10:06,980
equals prefs.get password and

130
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:12,110
I'll make the default again and then an
empty string and integer

131
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:17,150
port equals prefs.get well

132
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,800
actually at this point I'm probably gonna
have

133
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,460
to do a little bit more work so integers.

134
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:25,140
To sort of get suppressed will get caught.

135
00:10:26,302 --> 00:10:29,210
And let's make the default three three,
zero six.

136
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:35,030
Which is the default MySQL port.

137
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:41,700
Now, for the port, press dot get, is gonna
return a string.

138
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,390
But actually what I could do here.

139
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:48,400
Which would be simp, simpler, actually,
now [LAUGH] that I

140
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,592
think of it, is, I could use prefs put in
there.

141
00:10:50,592 --> 00:10:54,103
Instead of converting this to a string.

142
00:10:54,103 --> 00:10:56,410
I can just, put [INAUDIBLE] directly.

143
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:59,133
And then I can use here, the get in method

144
00:10:59,133 --> 00:11:02,280
and the default can be three three zero
six there.

145
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:05,530
That's a much better idea.

146
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:08,250
Okay, so press has this put for strings.

147
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:08,820
And there's also.

148
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:12,050
Put in four integers and get into four

149
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:14,600
integers and I think that will do the
trick.

150
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,620
So, let's, let's test this and see if it
works.

151
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:20,180
If I run that and, and go to preferences
here.

152
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,800
Let's type user.

153
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,890
John password hello.

154
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:29,310
And let's set the port here to three three
zero seven, click OK.

155
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:31,910
And now of course it's still gonna

156
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:35,010
have those values while the application's
running

157
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:38,090
because the dialog doesn't actually, it's
not

158
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:40,390
actually destroyed just cuz if I click OK.

159
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:43,470
But if I clear the application, and run it
again, with a

160
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:47,020
bit of luck, it will load, my default
preferences and there we go.

161
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:53,300
So using preferences it's pretty simple.

162
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:56,020
And it's a lot like putting keys to a map.

163
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,640
If you've just got put and get and it

164
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:02,310
stores it somewhere in your operating
system and the actual.

165
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:07,280
Plus a file and the location of the file,
is gonna depend on your operating system.

166
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:10,010
It doesn't really matter, but the bottom
line is

167
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:12,520
that you can create these nodes and store
sets of

168
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:16,760
preferences, onto these nodes between runs
of your application which

169
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:20,440
is suitable for little bits of data like
this stuff.

170
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,290
Okay, so that's it for this tutorial.

171
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:28,429
And in the next tutorial we're just gonna
look at.

172
00:12:29,476 --> 00:12:34,484
Making your dialogues, a little bit
prettier using panels because, this

173
00:12:34,484 --> 00:12:40,204
dialogue looks like a whole [UNKNOWN] and
what I want to do, is I wanna align the

174
00:12:40,204 --> 00:12:45,210
bottom [UNKNOWN] to the right and have
like a nice panel with a border

175
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:49,610
that sort of thing, so we gonna look at
that in the next tutorial.

176
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:53,110
So join me again then, and until next
time, happy coding.

177
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:58,149
