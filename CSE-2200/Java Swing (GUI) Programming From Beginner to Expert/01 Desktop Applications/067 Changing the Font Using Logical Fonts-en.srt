Hello, this is John from
caveofprogramming.com.

2
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:09,230
And in this tutorial, we're gonna look at
setting the font.

3
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:12,520
So if I run the application here in this

4
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:16,720
mess, message panel above, you've got a
text window here.

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,940
It's, it's actually a J text area, and I'm
gonna show you how to set the font on that

6
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:28,980
text area, but actually, Swing components
in general, the ones that display text

7
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:36,300
usually have a set font method, and I'm
going to show you the set font for J text

8
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:41,309
area that equally well applies to labels
and buttons and all kinds of things.

9
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:46,910
So my text area is actually within this
text panel class I created.

10
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:52,880
And I'm going to call here textArea, so
this is the J text area here.

11
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:59,580
I'm going to call text area.setfont.

12
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:05,520
And to set font, and this method as I say
is the same for labels and all kinds

13
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:10,850
of controls, I'm gonna pass a new font
object,

14
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:13,830
and let's have the input load, Ctrl +
Shift load.

15
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:19,210
Now this has a constructor that takes
three arguments, and

16
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:22,140
the first argument specifies what kind of
font you want.

17
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:26,530
So actually in this tutorial I'm gonna
show you

18
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:31,080
how to use what's called logical fonts and
Swing.

19
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,350
And the way the logical fonts work is that
you say what kind of

20
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:39,970
fonts you want and Swing then chooses an
appropriate font from the system for you.

21
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,900
You can also load specific font files, and
we'll look at that in the next tutorial.

22
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,140
So the first argument here is a string.

23
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:55,165
And the string can be one of serif,

24
00:01:55,165 --> 00:02:01,150
sans-serif monospaced, dialogue or
dialogue input.

25
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:06,240
So dialogue and dialogue input are kinds
of fonts for dialogue boxes.

26
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,580
And monospaced means a font where each
character takes up

27
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,970
the same amount of space, and that's
useful for displaying data.

28
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:22,663
For example, if someone sent you a, like a
file that's in CSV format exactly,

29
00:02:22,663 --> 00:02:27,220
that's a bad example; well, a file where
they've protect file, where they've tried

30
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:32,080
to sort of create a table using text; now,
then you want all the

31
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,380
characters to be the same lengths, so the
different rows of the table line up.

32
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:42,920
And serif mean a font that has

33
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,780
basically twiddles on it and sans-serif
without twiddles.

34
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,060
Let's take a look at examples rather than
me just talking.

35
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:54,710
So let's start with serif here and the
second argument is whether

36
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:57,350
you want it to be plain, bold or italic,
and I'm going to

37
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:04,230
go for plain here and certainly is
aesthetic variable

38
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:08,690
of the font class, and the final argument
is the size of the font in points.

39
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:12,150
I'm going to try setting a 20 point font
here.

40
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,290
So let's take a look at that.

41
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:21,170
And if I run that and now, we can see that
we've got a serif font here.

42
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:24,840
And you can tell it's serif because if you
look, for example, at

43
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:29,010
the bottom of the Y here, it's got a
little bulb on it.

44
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:32,900
It has various twiddles that you wouldn't
get in a sans-serif.

45
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,970
Let's take a look at some more examples.

46
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:39,992
If I set here sans-serif, sans-serif and
run that,

47
00:03:39,992 --> 00:03:45,234
sans-serif font doesn't have those
twiddles, so

48
00:03:45,234 --> 00:03:50,607
now you can see there's no bulb at the
bottom of the Y.

49
00:03:50,607 --> 00:03:53,150
The H doesn't have like bulbs on it.

50
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:56,010
If you look at the serif font, H is like,
at

51
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:59,040
the ends of the lines, it's got like a
little thing.

52
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,602
And that's missing in the sans-serif.

53
00:04:00,602 --> 00:04:03,776
So sans-serif fonts are just plainer than
serif fonts.

54
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:09,080
Actually, I don't want to turn this in to
a lesson on types

55
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:14,062
of fonts, but I'll just show you the three
most useful

56
00:04:14,062 --> 00:04:19,714
types, and the other one, monospaced is
sometimes useful.

57
00:04:19,714 --> 00:04:22,118
So if we look now, kind of looks a

58
00:04:22,118 --> 00:04:25,780
bit like a sort of, sort of teletype type
thing.

59
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,870
And, but I think actually, the one that
looks best for

60
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:35,920
this message dialogue is the serif, so
let's stick with that.

61
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:43,190
And as I say, you can make that, bold or
italic, instead of plain.

62
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:45,830
Okay, so I'm going to leave it there for
this tutorial, and

63
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:49,500
in the next tutorial, we're gonna look at
how to load font

64
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,100
files so you can set specific font if you
want if you

65
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:56,800
want to, so join me again then and until
then, happy coding.
