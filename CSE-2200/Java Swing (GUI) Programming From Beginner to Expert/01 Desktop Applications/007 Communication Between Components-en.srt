00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:06,120
Hi, this is John from Cave on Programming
dot com and in the

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,380
last tutorial I showed you how to create
this little application here, and

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:14,700
at the moment, this button adds stuff to
this text area and these

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,540
button in this little toolbar don't do
anything but I want them to add.

5
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:22,590
Text to the text area instead of this
button.

6
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:31,600
Now the challenge here is, if I look at
the code and I go to the mainframe, so the

7
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:35,300
mainframe is adding a toolbar that I've
created, with

8
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:39,310
custom components that I showed you how to
create earlier.

9
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:40,060
it's adding this.

10
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:42,920
Custom text panel component.

11
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:46,790
But how do you get communication going
between the two?

12
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:54,840
And I'll show you what you could do and
then we'll look at the problems with that.

13
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,210
And we'll look at how to improve it.

14
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:00,150
So what you really want ideally, is
something like this.

15
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:05,560
Where you've got a listener kind of model
where you're listening to one component.

16
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,520
And when something happens in that
component, it invokes a

17
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,530
method and then you tell another component
what to do directly.

18
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:19,650
So the main frame class here is, it's
acting as what

19
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:24,230
we call a controller and if you are total
familiar controller architecture,

20
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:29,600
then you'll recognize it in the main
frame, is the

21
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,420
controller here is, hocking together the
components and telling them what to do.

22
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,140
And if you're not familiar with it, don't
worry,

23
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,960
because you will be by the end of this
course.

24
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:45,290
So, now what I want to do is the simplest

25
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:47,350
thing to do and, this is not the best
thing.

26
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:52,800
Will be to pass a reference to the text
panel to the tool bar

27
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,510
and then get the tool bar to cause a
method in the text panel.

28
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:57,650
So, let's look at how that would work.

29
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:01,260
And what I want to do really, is firstly I

30
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:06,580
gotta pass the text panel to the tool bar
somehow.

31
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,310
So I'll have to give the tool bar a method

32
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:15,580
called, let's say set text panel and then
I'll pass in.

33
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,260
And reference to the text panel.

34
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,470
The text panel of course is created here.

35
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:25,410
And here I am just passing this reference
to it.

36
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:27,530
So it's a walk in cabinet, you can get at
it.

37
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:31,610
And I'm going to implement this message,
set text panel, so let's do that.

38
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:37,505
And I'll go to tool bar, and I'll give it
a.

39
00:02:37,505 --> 00:02:41,645
Public void set text panel.

40
00:02:41,645 --> 00:02:48,665
Text panel accepts a text panel, like this
and

41
00:02:48,665 --> 00:02:54,055
now when these buttons are clicked, I want
them to do something with this text

42
00:02:54,055 --> 00:02:59,835
panel, so that I can pass this nest to
these buttons, and.

43
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,430
Cuz it were two very similar buttons here.

44
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:10,220
What I do is I need to add actions
listeners to these buttons so that I can.

45
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:13,640
So that basically the toolbar is listening
to the buttons on it

46
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,440
and it can respawn when they are click,
when they are clicked.

47
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:25,430
So I'm gonna make this toolbar implement
action listener like this.

48
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:29,010
And implement action listener.

49
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:36,210
I'll add the import there and Implements
Action Listener, there we go.

50
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:42,837
And then, if I click this arrow I can add
unimplemented

51
00:03:42,837 --> 00:03:47,869
methods and I've added the Action Perform
Method

52
00:03:47,869 --> 00:03:52,657
to, to the toolbar itself, and that means
I can

53
00:03:52,657 --> 00:03:57,689
then do helloButton.addActionListener
this,

54
00:03:57,689 --> 00:04:02,623
and goodByeButton.addActionListener this.

55
00:04:02,623 --> 00:04:04,937
[BLANK_AUDIO]

56
00:04:04,937 --> 00:04:07,871
And just to see, if this works.

57
00:04:07,871 --> 00:04:12,834
Here in the actionPerformMethod I could
just do a

58
00:04:12,834 --> 00:04:17,562
sys out and, I'll put some text in here.

59
00:04:17,562 --> 00:04:22,553
I'll put a button has been clicked, and if
I run this application now.

60
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:26,667
And it's always a good idea to run your
application frequently, and put

61
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:31,330
debugging messages here to check that it's
working as you expect at every stage.

62
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:34,210
If I just save that, and then.

63
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:35,640
Run it.

64
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,070
If I click these buttons, you can see that
down

65
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:42,690
in the, in the console I'm getting some
text output.

66
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,880
Now the first kinda defect here before I
mess about with this text

67
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,200
panel any further is that I want to know
which button has been clicked.

68
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,530
Clicked.

69
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:53,540
And I can do that.

70
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,040
Let's rename this Arg Naught.

71
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,140
So the actual perform method receives an
action event.

72
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:03,090
And let's call that E, for event.

73
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:06,390
And let's say

74
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,503
I can say.

75
00:05:10,503 --> 00:05:18,217
J button clicked equals e dot get source.

76
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:22,660
And e, e dot get source.

77
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:25,940
Retrieves the actual source of the event.

78
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:30,240
Which in this case will be one of these
two buttons.

79
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,360
And it returns an object, but because I
know

80
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,530
that I've only added the action list here
to buttons.

81
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:40,090
I can just cast this to a J button.

82
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:44,520
So, now clicked will be the actual button
that

83
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:49,180
was clicked and the info this action
performed event.

84
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,900
File is action listener thing here.

85
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:58,230
I can then say if clicked, equals equals
hello

86
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:03,320
button, in other words, if the source is
just a reference here,

87
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:07,490
if this is a reference to this button, and
points,

88
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:10,350
and point to the same place as this, so if
clicked.

89
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:17,552
Click is equal to hello button, then sys
out hello.

90
00:06:17,552 --> 00:06:24,940
Else, sys out goodbye.

91
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:25,930
Good bye.

92
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:28,610
And so if I run that, let's check that it

93
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:32,030
works, and I click hello, and it says
hello down here.

94
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:34,420
I click goodbye, and it says, goodbye,
which is perfect.

95
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:42,840
And now, I just wanna hook this up with
the, with the text panel.

96
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:47,320
So I can, I need to get this text panel
reference

97
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:51,090
somehow, into this method, and to do that,
of course, I just.

98
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:56,590
Let's use a private instance variable, so
private text panel,

99
00:06:56,590 --> 00:07:03,446
text panel, and then in the set method, I
can just say

100
00:07:03,446 --> 00:07:08,570
this dot text panel equals

101
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:13,450
text panel, so the private instance text
panel equals the one that's passed in.

102
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:15,840
And now finally.

103
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:25,618
Finally, in down here I can say
textPanel.append

104
00:07:25,618 --> 00:07:30,340
text hello / and for a new line.

105
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:34,410
And if the goodbye button is clicked

106
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,010
then.

107
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:41,150
In fact no we'll say goodbye.

108
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:44,413
I thought maybe we'd be a bit clearer here
if I would say.

109
00:07:44,413 --> 00:07:53,711
Else if clicked equals goodbye button.

110
00:07:53,711 --> 00:07:59,430
Now if I run this, and I click,

111
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:04,770
and it says Hello in the text panel and
Goodbye, it says goodbye.

112
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:08,060
Get rid of this, this button here.

113
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:11,770
The button that I originally added in the
first place because

114
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:14,170
I don't want it anymore, so let's get rid
of all this.

115
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:23,170
Now, this basically gets your application
up and running.

116
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,990
And it works.

117
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:26,610
As you can see.

118
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:29,260
But, there's some major disadvantages
here.

119
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,239
To doing it like this because.

120
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:38,940
What you really want is you want your
swing application to be made up

121
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:45,070
of separate components that know as little
about each other as possible.

122
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:46,826
And the way I've written this in a moment.

123
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:52,780
The toolbar is inextricably linked to the
text panel.

124
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:55,510
The toolbar is tightly coupled with the
text panel.

125
00:08:55,510 --> 00:09:00,460
And we say in lingo it can call any method
of text panel

126
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:03,830
and you can't have a toolbar here without
there being a text panel.

127
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:06,740
It's not terribly reusable.

128
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:10,740
And if you look at your application and,
bear in mind, that

129
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:14,390
it could soon be much more complex than,
than it is now.

130
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:19,260
If you wanna debug the communication here
that's going

131
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:23,020
on that's causing these buttons to result
in this happening.

132
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,990
It's gonna be ultimately a bit of a
mystery.

133
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:28,090
Where to look for it.

134
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:29,810
What you really want is, you want to be

135
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:33,410
able to say okay, there's communication
happening to components.

136
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:36,170
That's happening in my controller.

137
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:39,830
My controller is the main frame, and the
communication should be hooked up here.

138
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:46,620
But instead what's happening is there's
communication going on.

139
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:53,470
Basically directly between the text panel,
between the toolbar and the text panel.

140
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:57,060
And if you carry on writing a whole
application

141
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:01,040
like this, it's gonna start resembling a
rat's nest.

142
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,640
And that's why in the next tutorial, we're
gonna look at.

143
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,200
A bit of a better way to do this.

144
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:11,764
And we're gonna look at how to separate
more cleanly your toolbar from your

145
00:10:11,764 --> 00:10:17,432
toolbar custom component from your this J
Text Area custom component.

146
00:10:17,432 --> 00:10:22,606
And the object is that will provide you
with a model for building up really

147
00:10:22,606 --> 00:10:28,037
complex Swing applications, and keeping
them from getting into a rat's nest.

148
00:10:28,037 --> 00:10:29,220
Okay, so.

149
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:33,057
And, join me again next time, and until
