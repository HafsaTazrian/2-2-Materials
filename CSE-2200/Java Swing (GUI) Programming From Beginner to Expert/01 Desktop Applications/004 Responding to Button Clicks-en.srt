00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:02,620
Hi, welcome back.

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:05,790
And in the last tutorial, I showed you how

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:09,680
to create this little application which
doesn't actually do anything.

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:13,360
And in this tutorial, I'm gonna fix it so
when you

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,900
click the button, it adds stuff to the
text area here.

6
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:25,590
So, I'm gonna navigate here to my main
frame and what I

7
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:31,430
wanna do, what I'm gonna do is, a kind of
common pattern for Swing Apps in general.

8
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:35,650
I'm gonna listen to one component and when
something happens

9
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:39,310
in that component, I'm gonna do something
to another component.

10
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:41,930
So I'm gonna listen to the button and when
the button

11
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:45,470
is clicked I'm going to add some text into
the text area.

12
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:51,270
Now the way to do that is firstly, I want

13
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:56,360
to add a thing called an action listener
to the button.

14
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:01,200
So, to do that my button is called btn,
and it's this private variable here.

15
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:07,064
And I'm gonna say btn.addActionListener.

16
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:17,430
Now action, the add action listener method
takes as its augment a an action listener,

17
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:23,240
a figure type action listener and action
listener is actually an interface.

18
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:28,460
So what I could do and perhaps will do in
future tutorials at

19
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:33,840
some point is I could make Main Frame
implement the Action Listener

20
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,970
interface, and then pass this into this
method.

21
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:45,360
But, what I'm gonna do instead here is use
an anonymous class.

22
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,820
I'm gonna say new here, inside the
argument brackets.

23
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:54,740
A new action listener and then, brown
buckets.

24
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,580
So this a bit looks exactly as though

25
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:00,000
I was creating an object of type action
listener,

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,710
which of course isn't legal by itself
because

27
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:05,960
actually this is not a class, it's an
interface.

28
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,530
But what I can do is, I can open a bracket
here.

29
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:13,990
And eclipse puts in a closing bracket
automatically, and if I click on this

30
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:20,580
arrow here, I can go to what I need to
import action listener first.

31
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:26,940
And then, click on it click on it again, I
can go to Add unimplemented methods.

32
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:32,550
And the ActionListerner interface just has
this one method action

33
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:37,060
performed and this method is run whenever
the button is clicked.

34
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:40,260
So, let's get rid of some of these extra
lines here.

35
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:44,520
I'm just doing Ctrl+D to delete them and,
in

36
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,710
here, what I want to do is append some
text.

37
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,960
Text to the text area.

38
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:55,560
And to do that, I'm gonna say
textarea.append

39
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,800
and that accepts a string and I'll pass
the string hello and I'll put, also

40
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,640
backslash end there to add a new line at
the end of each string and of each hello.

41
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:11,830
So, I'm listening to the button by setting
an

42
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:15,460
action listener on it, which is this
anonymous class.

43
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:19,591
And within the method, the action
performed method of the

44
00:03:19,591 --> 00:03:25,410
anonymous class, I'm directly invoking a
method of the text area.

45
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:26,740
And I was gonna say, this is quite a
common

46
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:31,520
pattern, in swing, or in GUI applications
in general, I suppose.

47
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:37,110
So if I run that now, I need to select
the, main program here, and run that.

48
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:43,990
Now, if I click the bottom, you can see it
adds, a load, to the text area.

49
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,690
Okay, so that's it for this tutorial.

50
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:53,860
And in, in the next part of this tutorial
series, I'm gonna show you how to begin to

51
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:59,890
break up a Swing application into separate
classes, separate custom components.

52
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:02,860
And we're gonna add a toolbar to this.

53
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:05,100
And we're gonna add some scroll bars to
the text pane.

54
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,470
And we're gonna have the toolbar in the

55
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:11,880
text area as two separate kind of custom
components.

56
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,140
So until next time, happy coding.
