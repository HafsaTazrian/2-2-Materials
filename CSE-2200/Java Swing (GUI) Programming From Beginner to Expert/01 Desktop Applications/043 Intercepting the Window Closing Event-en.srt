00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:05,270
Hello there, this is John from
caveofprogramming.com.

2
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:10,850
And in this tutorial we're gonna look at
intercepting the window closing event.

3
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:16,520
And one reason to do that, is so that you
can clear up clean up resources in

4
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:22,500
there, and in this case, we're gonna use
it to disconnect from a database.

5
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,510
So actually, one thing to do, is to make
sure that

6
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:30,170
you can disconnect from your database,
even if you haven't connected.

7
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:33,190
So let's go to the Connect method in the
database here.

8
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:36,730
And you can see that I've checked, but the
connection's not null.

9
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:37,770
Because that can lead to a a very

10
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:41,708
nasty error, if you try to disconnect from
something.

11
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:45,750
And it's, it's null where you get that no
point reception.

12
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:51,150
Okay, so let's go in to the mainframe code
here.

13
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:57,996
And at the moment, I've, I've got this
exit on close thing happening, so I've,

14
00:00:57,996 --> 00:01:01,743
I've caught Set Default close operation
for the

15
00:01:01,743 --> 00:01:05,830
JFrame, and I've said JFrame exit on
close.

16
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:09,970
And I'm gonna change that, that means that
when

17
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:15,830
you close the JFrame, it's gonna quit the
application.

18
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:22,298
I'm gonna change that to do nothing on
close for the moment,

19
00:01:22,298 --> 00:01:28,310
and now, I'm gonna add a Window Listener
to my JFrame.

20
00:01:29,398 --> 00:01:36,195
So I'm gonna say Add Window Listener, and
I'll say New, and I'm not

21
00:01:36,195 --> 00:01:37,950
gonna use the Window Listener itself,
because

22
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:41,580
Window Listener has like 5 million
different methods.

23
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:46,660
I'm gonna use a window adapter, which is a
class that implements all the

24
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:51,960
methods of Window Listener, and let's me
override just the ones that I need.

25
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,200
And it's been sent to a mouse adapter if
you know how that kinda code works.

26
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,788
But don't worry if you don't.

27
00:01:59,788 --> 00:02:04,261
So I'm gonna do go and I'm gonna say
import Window Adapter there.

28
00:02:04,261 --> 00:02:06,480
And then let's right click in there,

29
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:10,198
and go to Source, overwrite and implement
message.

30
00:02:10,198 --> 00:02:13,420
And I'm gonna override the window closing,
because

31
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:18,218
I wanna get the window as it's closing.

32
00:02:18,218 --> 00:02:22,020
And in here, let's close this out just for
the moment

33
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:27,840
and say, window closing, cuz we wanna see
when it actually arises.

34
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:33,240
And now, I I mentioned earlier, well I
mentioned

35
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,050
in the last tutorial that sometimes, if
you quit

36
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:38,510
the application here, really clicking the
cross in the

37
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:46,000
corner, you see like stack trays here,
about interrupting threads.

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,150
And if you search on Google, that seems to
be, be

39
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:53,320
a, a bookend swing, and it may be related
to JFile chosers.

40
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:58,620
but, I, I've, I've found, and this seems
to help.

41
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:03,770
But if you do system, system.gc.

42
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:08,970
So you run the Garbage Collector, like
this, before quitting the application.

43
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:10,350
That seems to help.

44
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:14,051
And I'm also here, because, I'm gonna

45
00:03:14,051 --> 00:03:16,870
enter Set Window Closing, print out this
message,

46
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:20,270
and then I'm gonna call the JFrame dispose

47
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:24,200
method, which is gonna dispose of my
window.

48
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:30,660
And when you've disposed of your windows
in Swing, then it, it quits automatically.

49
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:33,500
I'm just gonna run the garbage collector
at the

50
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:38,060
last possible moment before the thing
finally bows out.

51
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:42,940
So let's just see how, how that looks if I
run that as a Java application,

52
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:48,670
I need to select main class and click the
Run button.

53
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:52,230
When I click the cross in the corner and
we've got the window closing

54
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:53,990
event, and there's no trace about, which

55
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:56,940
is nice although it was intermittent as
before.

56
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,870
But it looks good as far as I can see.

57
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:00,940
I'm pretty happy with that.

58
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:06,150
But now, you can still quit the
application by going CTRL+X or

59
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:10,150
going to the window of the file menu and
go into File Exit.

60
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:14,830
So, and that doesn't produce a window
closing event.

61
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:17,218
So I wanna make that work, and

62
00:04:17,218 --> 00:04:22,200
I've actually called system.exit somewhere
in here.

63
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:27,286
So I've set system.exit here, and that's
the, this

64
00:04:27,286 --> 00:04:31,970
is the Action Listener on the Exit Menu
item.

65
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:34,322
And actually one alternative to calling
systems that

66
00:04:34,322 --> 00:04:36,200
I've set there, to simply log with
Cleaner.

67
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,850
I used to call it dispose method cuz if
you dispose your

68
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:41,700
windows, then your frame, your swing

69
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,520
application will exit automatically and if
you

70
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,650
actually just want to do a manage to be,
your windows to become

71
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:51,630
invisible, but for the application not to
quit then you would just call.

72
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:53,490
That physical fonts on them.

73
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:59,870
So, here on this point, I want to create a
window closing event,

74
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:06,940
because I've added a window adapter that
listens for the window closing event.

75
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:14,700
And what I could do there is my main frame
actually has a method called Get.

76
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:19,120
Window listeners not window status

77
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,860
cause that's something different, but
getWindowListeners.

78
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:25,390
And that returns an array of Window
Listeners.

79
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:34,160
So Window Listener, and that is an array.

80
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:39,063
So having trouble here because
unfortunately, the

81
00:05:39,063 --> 00:05:44,460
right bracket on my system conflicts with
another shortcut.

82
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:48,490
I've got like a Hungarian keyboard here.

83
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:53,370
I'm trying desperately to type that
[INAUDIBLE] and that have ellipse put in.

84
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:54,278
There we go.

85
00:05:54,278 --> 00:05:56,447
So WindowListener, Listeners.

86
00:05:56,447 --> 00:05:58,598
And one of the listeners is the, the

87
00:05:58,598 --> 00:06:02,100
listener that I just started, the window
adapter.

88
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,750
That's probably the only one.

89
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:10,293
So I'm gonna say let's get rid of this
extra text, and say WindowListener array.

90
00:06:10,293 --> 00:06:15,900
Listeners equals getWindowListeners at the
import

91
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:21,000
and then, I can say let's see why it
doesn't load that?

92
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,702
Cannot be resolved to a type.

93
00:06:22,702 --> 00:06:25,150
Window [UNKNOWN].

94
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,160
WindowListener.

95
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,500
Not WindowsListener.

96
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,200
There we go.

97
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:34,465
Then I can say 4, or at least this is

98
00:06:34,465 --> 00:06:37,060
one way of doing this, but there are other
ways, certainly.

99
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:41,620
For WindowListener, Listener, and
Listeners.

100
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:43,693
I can just say listener.,

101
00:06:43,693 --> 00:06:47,841
and it's not gotten many methods, I don't
wanna call

102
00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:52,800
the window closing method here, and that
accepts the window

103
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:58,026
event, so you say new window event, the
source I could make

104
00:06:58,026 --> 00:07:03,660
mainframe.this, let's say, and does it
have another argument?

105
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,700
Yeah, so let's just press in 0 for that

106
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:08,880
second [INAUDIBLE] argument, which is just
an ID interface

107
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,820
integrating inside of your [INAUDIBLE] but
it doesn't, it

108
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:15,690
doesn't matter, it's not gonna make any
difference here.

109
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:21,130
As long as this does the trick, because
all this has to do here is basically make

110
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:25,103
sure that the the window adapter, which is
listening,

111
00:07:25,103 --> 00:07:29,210
.task, this code's gonna be a bit long
actually.

112
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,100
It just, we just need to call that

113
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:36,020
window closing method, and that's what
we've done here.

114
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,830
That's exactly what I've done.

115
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,640
So let's go back there.

116
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:44,240
So, Control > Home > Window > Closing.

117
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,700
And now, if I run this, and if I, if I

118
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:55,110
invoke this File Exit menu item, you still
get Window Closing when you print it out,

119
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:56,690
so whichever way we're quitting the
application

120
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:58,910
now, through the File menu or through

121
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:03,510
the cross in the corner, we get this
window closing, which is rather nice.

122
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:08,035
So, all I need to do now hopefully, is
just call

123
00:08:08,035 --> 00:08:14,590
controller.disconnect and if if I haven't
connected, cuz I haven't

124
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:18,920
clicked Save or Refresh then it's fine,
we've accounted for that possibility.

125
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,670
And if I have clicked.

126
00:08:22,648 --> 00:08:25,120
It's okay to click Save actually.

127
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,284
If I, if I hit Refresh I'd quit,

128
00:08:27,284 --> 00:08:30,760
then it's gonna disconnect from my
database, hopefully.

129
00:08:32,515 --> 00:08:34,687
Okay, so that's it for this tutorial.

130
00:08:34,687 --> 00:08:38,886
In the next tutorial, we're gonna get away
from this

131
00:08:38,886 --> 00:08:44,371
database related stuff and, we're gonna
look at setting icon, icons

132
00:08:44,371 --> 00:08:48,997
on buttons, and that'll be a step towards
using a JToolbar

133
00:08:48,997 --> 00:08:54,083
component, yeah, so we'll turn this into a
fully fledged toolbar.

134
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:57,493
So join me again then, and until next
time, happy coding.

135
00:08:57,493 --> 00:08:57,497
