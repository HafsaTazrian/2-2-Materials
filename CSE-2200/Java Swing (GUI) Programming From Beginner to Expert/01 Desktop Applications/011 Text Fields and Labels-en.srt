Hello there.

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:09,500
In this tutorial we're gonna look at text
fields and labels, in Swing.

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:14,318
So in the last tutorial I created this
little application and I

4
00:00:14,318 --> 00:00:19,730
wanna add here a couple of little text
fields for entering information.

5
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:22,560
And also a couple of, labels to say what
the

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,360
text fields are and underneath I want to
have a button.

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,890
So, that you can click the button to
submit the information.

8
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,680
and, to do that I'm gonna start by going
to Font panel, and I'm gonna

9
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,650
give it some number variables which will
be

10
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:41,270
the controls, I'm gonna use in the panel.

11
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:48,515
So I'll have two labels, JLabel, [SOUND]
and

12
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:54,081
I'm gonna call one of them, Name Label.

13
00:00:54,081 --> 00:00:57,596
New send new, actually I'll do the new in

14
00:00:57,596 --> 00:01:02,526
the constructor so I'll call it, [SOUND]
NameLabel here.

15
00:01:02,526 --> 00:01:07,214
And private JLabel, occupation level,
because this is gonna

16
00:01:07,214 --> 00:01:11,820
be a form for adding some information
about people.

17
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,650
And it's sort of private JTextField.

18
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:22,670
Now, a JTextField is, a single line field
of text like this kinda thing here.

19
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:29,200
As opposed to a text area which is a
whole, area like the editor I'm in here.

20
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:35,291
So I want a JTextField named field,
[SOUND] and a

21
00:01:35,291 --> 00:01:41,548
private JTextField, occupationField.

22
00:01:41,548 --> 00:01:47,115
And I'm also gonna have a button to submit
the information, so I'll say

23
00:01:47,115 --> 00:01:53,094
private JButton, [SOUND] and I'll just
call that okBtn, OK button.

24
00:01:53,094 --> 00:01:58,324
So now in the constructor I'm gonna,
actually create, create those objects.

25
00:01:58,324 --> 00:02:04,677
So I'll say, nameLabel equals new JLabel.

26
00:02:04,677 --> 00:02:07,990
And I'll give this some text here in the,
in

27
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:12,927
the constructor parameter which is gonna
be, [SOUND] name colon.

28
00:02:12,927 --> 00:02:14,271
And the.

29
00:02:14,271 --> 00:02:19,379
Occupation label is gonna be, [SOUND]
occupation

30
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:24,364
label is gonna be new JLabel [SOUND]
occupation.

31
00:02:24,364 --> 00:02:27,988
Occupation.

32
00:02:27,988 --> 00:02:35,521
And, the the name field, name field.

33
00:02:35,521 --> 00:02:44,668
Is going to be a new JLabel, it's going to
be sorry, a new JTextField.

34
00:02:44,668 --> 00:02:48,033
And now the important thing here is when
you create, create your

35
00:02:48,033 --> 00:02:52,630
text field, you have to specify how many
characters wide it should be.

36
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:55,580
And the strange thing is that the text
fields

37
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:59,100
always appear wider than the number of
characters would suggest.

38
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,364
As far as I know, this is supposed to

39
00:03:01,364 --> 00:03:05,673
represent, [SOUND] characters it's just
that it's a bit off.

40
00:03:05,673 --> 00:03:11,339
Okay so, and I'm also gonna have
occupationField equals new JTextField,

41
00:03:11,339 --> 00:03:16,220
I'll make that ten as well, we can always
change the size later.

42
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,300
And finally the button, so.

43
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,701
OkayBtn, and notice I'm spacing out my
code here,

44
00:03:23,701 --> 00:03:28,976
[SOUND] into distinct sections using blank
lines, which helps legibility.

45
00:03:28,976 --> 00:03:34,153
So equals new, [SOUND] JButton, and I'll
just give that the label here.

46
00:03:34,153 --> 00:03:36,911
Okay.

47
00:03:36,911 --> 00:03:40,880
And now I'm gonna leave it there, for this
tutorial.

48
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,380
Because in the next tutorial, we're gonna
get to something that's,

49
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:49,850
probably the second most complex thing
after the whole event listener business.

50
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:51,750
And that's the grid back layout.

51
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,456
Which is an extremely flexible way but a

52
00:03:54,456 --> 00:03:57,761
bit tricky, of laying out your components
in Swing.

53
00:03:57,761 --> 00:04:02,209
So, join me again for that tutorial and
until then, happy coding.

54
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:04,320
