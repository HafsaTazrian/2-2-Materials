00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:05,370
Hello this is John from
caveofprogramming.com, and this

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:09,150
is a tutorial on dialogues in Java Swing.

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,160
So, I'm gonna take this application and
I'm

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,669
gonna add a preferences item to the window
menu.

5
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:16,690
And that's gonna bring up a dialogue that

6
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:21,210
allows me to set some preferences for my
application.

7
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:27,167
So I'm gonna start by creating a new class
in this GUI package here.

8
00:00:27,167 --> 00:00:30,389
So say new class and we're going to call
that PrefsDialogue.

9
00:00:30,389 --> 00:00:35,040
An, and that's going to extend JDialogue.

10
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:41,220
And I'll have the end quote there and, and
I'm gonna basically do the same

11
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:45,860
thing with this class that I've been doing
with panels and with my main frame.

12
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:52,260
I'm gonna give it a constructor, public
prefs, prefs dialog,

13
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:58,070
and, and in the constructor I'm gonna add
some widgets to this and to this dialog.

14
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,324
So for the moment, back in main frame
here.

15
00:01:03,324 --> 00:01:11,490
I'm gonna give mainframe a instance
variable of the off type, prefs dialogue.

16
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:13,540
And i'll call that pref's dialogue.

17
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:19,920
And down here lets that equal to mu and
set

18
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,890
press dialogue equal to mu prefs dialog
capital P there.

19
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:33,160
Now to to show this dialog all I need to
do is call set visible true.

20
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:38,250
Actually, before I do that let's let's

21
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:43,540
change a few things here because one thing
I wanna call the

22
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:49,320
super constructor, and I'm gonna use

23
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:54,250
a version of the constructor that takes
three parameters.

24
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:59,020
It takes the a reference to the owner of
the dialog, the parent window

25
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:03,470
and the title and a true or false that
says whether it's modal or not.

26
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:08,060
Modal dialogs are ones that don't allow

27
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,200
you do anything else while their actually
open.

28
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:16,180
Which is usually the case of the J option
pane dialogs and non modal dialogs.

29
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:22,060
Allow you to carry on working, while
they're open, so let's

30
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:27,084
here, I'm gonna make this take a reference
to a J frame,

31
00:02:27,084 --> 00:02:32,150
let's say frame, and let's just pass that
in the, it's called

32
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:36,870
a, maybe I'll that parent, because it's
actually the parent of this dialogue.

33
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:42,500
The window that the dialogue is kinda
attached to, if you like.

34
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,610
Let's have a title here.

35
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:54,320
So I'll make the title preferences,
preferences and let's say false for

36
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:58,705
modal, and later I'm gonna change that to
true just so you can see the difference.

37
00:02:58,705 --> 00:03:06,647
[SOUND] Now in main frame here, I'm
passing this, so let's see parent here.

38
00:03:06,647 --> 00:03:14,480
Let's snap the input here for jframe, and
I'll also get this dialog size.

39
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:19,030
I'll say setSize and let's just make that,

40
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:25,080
I don't know, 400 and by 300 let's say.

41
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,550
Just so we can see it.

42
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,944
And, and that's enough of that.

43
00:03:32,944 --> 00:03:35,844
And I'm not gonna call setPhysical here
because

44
00:03:35,844 --> 00:03:38,750
setPhysical is gonna be called by my
mainframe.

45
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,940
Okay, so now I've got the preferences
dialog setup and

46
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:45,190
ready to use, so it's got no controls in
it.

47
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:48,180
And I'm gonna go down to the window menu
now.

48
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,560
The window menu at the moment just has a
sub menu called Show.

49
00:03:53,560 --> 00:04:00,944
I'm gonna add a new jmenu item call preps
item, set that equal to new jMenuItem.

50
00:04:00,944 --> 00:04:06,525
And that's gonna say preferences, and by
convention if

51
00:04:06,525 --> 00:04:10,990
you have a, menu item that brings up a
dialogue.

52
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:15,320
[UNKNOWN] an ellipses, like this, after
the text.

53
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:21,080
[UNKNOWN] and so let's add that here, so
windowmenu.add

54
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:25,928
prefsitem, and let's add an action list
next to the prefsitem.

55
00:04:25,928 --> 00:04:31,380
So prefsitem.listItem.add actionListener,
new actionListener, and you

56
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,280
know the drill for this by now.

57
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:41,790
And let's add the unimplemented method
there, the actionPerform method.

58
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:48,220
And put semicolon in, and here, all I'm
gonna do is say prefs

59
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:56,800
prefs dialogue dot set visible true, like
that.

60
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,010
And that's gonna show my dialogue, and to

61
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:02,460
hide the dialogue again, I'm gonna call
false,

62
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,750
but that's gonna happen, that invisible
false is

63
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:07,380
gonna happen within my dialogue itself, so
that's.

64
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,440
Just take a look at this and now if I

65
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:15,170
go to window preferences, and it brings up
my preferences dialog.

66
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:22,510
Now in the next tutorial, we're gonna look
at adding some controls to this dialog,

67
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:29,650
and we're gonna look at a, adding a j
spinner control.

68
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:30,660
Among other things.

69
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,060
So join me again then.

70
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:34,875
And until next time, happy coding.

71
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:38,804
[SOUND]
