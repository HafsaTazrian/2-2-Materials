00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:06,450
Hello, this is John from
caveofprogramming.com, and in

2
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,930
this tutorial we're gonna look up progress
bars.

3
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:15,590
So, at the moment if I run this
application, we've got,

4
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:22,580
when I click the tree, so, let's just wait
for it to stop, it's thinking about it.

5
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:27,170
Don't know why my computer is so slow
today.

6
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:31,960
If we go to the tree here, click this, we

7
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,590
see this dialog, which pops up, and then
disappears again.

8
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:39,640
And we're going to put a progress bar in
that dialog, but actually first, I'm going

9
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:44,920
to fix one little thing because I must
confess that in the

10
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:50,680
last tutorial, I actually showed you some
code that had a little bug in it, because

11
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:56,248
if you look at the message panel here when
it creates the dialog.

12
00:00:56,248 --> 00:00:59,880
It does window.getParent, but that
actually returns

13
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,410
null for reasons I don't fully understand.

14
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:06,670
And we're gonna fix that by putting parent
in here.

15
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:10,860
And parent, it's gonna be JFrame.

16
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,110
The actual parent window.

17
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:20,040
And when I create the message panel in the
main frame, I'm gonna pass in this.

18
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,064
And then finally, at the end of the chain
here, in the ProgressDialog.

19
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:26,820
I'll use that JFrame for the parent.

20
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:32,100
And I'm also gonna do the same trick which
I showed you before which is

21
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:37,100
set location relative to here in the
ProgressDialog.

22
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:41,020
Set location relative to two parent.

23
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,370
Now I'm not convinced that dialogue

24
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,720
positioning actually works properly in
swing.

25
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,400
But this is something of an improvement in
the at least the

26
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:57,379
dialog seems to come up basically in the
middle of the window which I'll show you.

27
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:00,750
If I can get this working.

28
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,790
Yeah, message panel, I'm typing input
there

29
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,630
to message panel, save everything, and
hopefully the

30
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:12,790
errors will go away, I can, there we go,
so now I move this application down

31
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:15,750
a little bit and bring the dialog so at
least now it's in the middle

32
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,168
of the screen and although whether it
actually

33
00:02:18,168 --> 00:02:21,800
move with his window I'm not entirely
sure.

34
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:27,680
Anyway, we'll leave that because this is
pretty acceptable I think.

35
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,180
And I'm gonna give this ProgressDialog
here two private variables.

36
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:36,440
Let's give it a private JButton, cancel
button.

37
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,410
And, and I'll also give it private

38
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:43,880
Jprogess bar, which I'll call progress
bar.

39
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:48,840
And in the constructor here after adding
the

40
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,690
input of Ctrl+Shift+O I'm gonna set a
cancel button.

41
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:56,500
Equal to a new JButton with the text

42
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,720
counselor on it, which is gonna be for
counseling.

43
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,320
Message retrieval in this case.

44
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,960
And the progress bar I'm gonna set equal

45
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:12,220
to a new JProgress bar, and here in
[INAUDIBLE].

46
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,190
Specify a minimum and maximum value.

47
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:18,930
But I don't think I need to here, because
I'm going

48
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:23,600
to set, the default minimum will be zero,
and the maximum

49
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,110
I'm going to set later on, as we go along,
in

50
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:29,920
fact I'm going to give this a method
looking for exact maximum.

51
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,820
And that's gonna take a int count.

52
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:41,443
And with that count it's just gonna say
progressbar.set maximum.

53
00:03:41,443 --> 00:03:43,210
Set maximum.

54
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:48,172
And what that does is it sets the the
numerical value of

55
00:03:48,172 --> 00:03:53,340
the progress bar that corresponds to 100%
complete, so

56
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:58,535
it could be 100 or 1,000 or ten or
whatever you like.

57
00:03:58,535 --> 00:04:00,150
And although it is an inter.

58
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,610
Mixture actually.

59
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:05,660
And then I'm also gonna give it a, let's,
let's [UNKNOWN] to here.

60
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:08,700
A public void setValue very important.

61
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:13,180
And I'll give that value, don't know why I
called this count, actually.

62
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:14,480
Up here.

63
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,000
Let's call this value.

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,730
As well, and then the value is just going
to, is just gonna do progress bar

65
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:26,280
dot set value and that's gonna set the
current value of the

66
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:31,210
progress bar and of course slightly
maximum value.

67
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:34,540
When this value here reaches this value
here.

68
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,680
Then you'll have 100% progress.

69
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,190
So, there's a few other things to do, I

70
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:42,610
need to add these two controls to the
dialog.

71
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:45,740
I'm going to get rid of setSize here and
I'm going to do setLayout.

72
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:46,240
I'm going to

73
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:52,740
set the layout to a new flow layout, which
is the layout manager you

74
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,580
might recall that just lets you add

75
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:57,380
components from right to, from left to
right.

76
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:01,230
And you can't even do vertical layouts in
flow layout.

77
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:03,250
It's a purely horizontal thing.

78
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:08,415
I'm gonna do add, progress

79
00:05:08,415 --> 00:05:13,780
bar, and add Cancel button here.

80
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:17,810
And I'm also gonna resize the progress
bar.

81
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:23,490
So that it has the same height as the
button and to do that, I'm going to say

82
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:29,100
size, actually dimension I'll call this
size.

83
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,750
I'm gonna set that equal to the size

84
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,790
retrieved from the console button, the
preferred size.

85
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:38,155
This will will say cancel
button.getPreferredSize.

86
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:45,630
And then, after writing the imports, I'll
do size dot width equals 400, and

87
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:51,500
I'll do progress bar.setPreferredSize.

88
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,760
So we're got this size from the button so
that we can

89
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,730
get the height of the progress bar the
same as the button.

90
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:57,950
But, of course, the progress bar.

91
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:58,660
Fours wider.

92
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,220
And so I've set the size to

93
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:04,720
wider before doing setPreferredSize on the
progress bar.

94
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,270
And finally after adding these two
controls I'm going to

95
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:12,280
call puck and puck sort of shrink wraps
your frame

96
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,700
or dialog around the controls so you've
added so it

97
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:19,280
will make it a minimum size for these two
controls.

98
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,400
Now we can [UNKNOWN] it.

99
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,880
Wire this into our message panel.

100
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,910
I've already got the instance variable
here and the

101
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:30,004
dialog already appears and disappears at
the right moments.

102
00:06:30,004 --> 00:06:33,160
But I'm going to also set the values.

103
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,150
So let's go through tree messages here.

104
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:41,210
Let's get rid of this text.sysout stuff.

105
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:43,000
Because we don't need that.

106
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,800
And in process, which is the method that
the publish

107
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:52,049
method ultimately invokes as you saw in
the last tutorial.

108
00:06:53,250 --> 00:07:00,524
I'm gonna say ProgressDialog.setValue
retrieved.

109
00:07:00,524 --> 00:07:04,280
And that's gonna set it, set the progress
according

110
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:08,220
to the messages retrieved, the number of
messages retrieved.

111
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:12,112
I also need to set the maximum up here,
so, here I'm using message

112
00:07:12,112 --> 00:07:17,430
server.getMessage count, and let's say,

113
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:22,710
ProgressDialog.set, maximum, so

114
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:26,900
the maximum value here will be the total
number message, messages that are waiting

115
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:33,460
to be retrieved and I think that's

116
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:39,710
just about ready to go now and so let's,
let's try that and and see how it looks.

117
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:40,950
So,.

118
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:43,600
If I run this, and it's not yet gonna be
perfect, but

119
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:48,560
if I run it, then we see that we've got
progress indicators here.

120
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:54,740
And by the way, if you don't know what the
maximum value is, of your, of the

121
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,220
kind of thing that you're doing in the

122
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:01,570
background, you can set progress bar set
indeterminate true.

123
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:06,350
And an indeterminate progress bar
basically

124
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,190
looks like this.

125
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:11,260
So it shows something's happening.

126
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:14,190
But, it doesn't give an indication of when
it's gonna finish.

127
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:18,620
Anyway we will use a, a determinant
version here, which is the default.

128
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:25,226
Now, there's, there's one thing that I'd
like to do here actually, which is that

129
00:08:25,226 --> 00:08:31,860
I'm calling [UNKNOWN] later to show the
dialog, to make it visible.

130
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:35,350
Because you might recal from the last
tutorial that if we

131
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:39,140
don't do that, doing set visible on a
mortal dialog just

132
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:43,540
causes everything else to be suspended and
nothing else can happen

133
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:46,730
and cuz this will not return until the
dialog goes away.

134
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:52,527
But I'm going to take this and copy it and
in my ProgressDialog here.

135
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,910
I'm going to override.

136
00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:03,028
I'm going to go to source, override
implement methods, and

137
00:09:03,028 --> 00:09:09,264
I'm going to override in dialog the I'm
going to override

138
00:09:09,264 --> 00:09:15,540
the show method here I think that's the
one I want, and in.

139
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:20,950
Here, that will not show actually, sorry
I'm talking rubbish,

140
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:26,930
I'm gonna over ride, shows actually
uh,duplicated, what I,

141
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:33,280
what I want it's the set visible which is
the newer way to do show on a dialog.

142
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,330
So I'm gonna find setVisible.

143
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:37,860
Which I know is in here somewhere.

144
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,090
Yeah, it's in dialog actually.

145
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:43,880
And where are we, setVisible, setVisible.

146
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,970
Here we go.

147
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:46,110
Let's override setVisible.

148
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,270
And in there, I can put this sort

149
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:54,080
of threading code and I can set the
visibility.

150
00:09:54,080 --> 00:10:00,970
Here let's call this visible and let's
baseline here as visible.

151
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:06,110
And I need to invoke the super.

152
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:11,170
And the super kind of progress style of
method.

153
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:16,160
So I, sorry not the soup but the this.

154
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,510
We're in here, we're in a dialogue that
extends JDialogue.

155
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:25,010
And in my overwritten set visible, I don't
want to invoke set visible itself.

156
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:32,280
I want invoke a super class setVisible and
to do that I have to say, I think I need

157
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:38,910
J, Well, actually, I could write, So I
need to name the class, ProgressDialog.

158
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:40,500
ProgressDialog.

159
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,170
And I don't wanna use this.

160
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:43,420
What I want to use is super.

161
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:45,960
So ProgressDialog.super.

162
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,100
And also to access this variable here.

163
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:51,960
And this, method of a anonymous class.

164
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,200
I'm gonna have to declare the parameter
here final.

165
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:57,660
And then.

166
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,790
That should all work I think.

167
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,450
So let's, let's take a look at that now.

168
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:06,430
Actually I've gotta take the [UNKNOWN] and
I can remove this from here.

169
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:10,490
And I can not worry about that here, cuz
it's

170
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:15,110
now built into the dialogue which, makes a
lot more sense.

171
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:17,830
There's one other little thing that I want
to fix here in this tutorial.

172
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:19,160
So, if you look in this dialogue now.

173
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,880
It looks pretty good, and it works.

174
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:26,030
but, you often don't quite see it.

175
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:27,520
See, see it going to 100%.

176
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:32,030
Although having said that, well, One thing
that we

177
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:34,788
need to fix actually, is, that's going to
these

178
00:11:34,788 --> 00:11:40,510
applications, is we need to make

179
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:46,400
sure that when you show the dialogue that
it's initialized to zero progress.

180
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:53,914
So let's go to the show method in its
ProgressDialog, and let's say progressBar

181
00:11:53,914 --> 00:12:00,860
.set value and let's set that to nought
right here.

182
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:06,830
And now let's see how this looks and so
I'll tick

183
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:10,809
something on so it's zero to start with
and then it finishes.

184
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:20,300
Now one thing that you often find at the
ProgressDialog is that annoying they never

185
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:23,660
seem to get to a hundred because this,

186
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:27,500
this second reaches a hundred, and then
disappears.

187
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,530
And to fix that.

188
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:31,030
Well there's all kinds of ways you could
fix that.

189
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:35,729
But what I'm going to do is think with
this setVisible

190
00:12:35,729 --> 00:12:41,680
method and I'm going to put in a little
delay before it, before it disappears.

191
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:51,600
So let's say here if physical actually,
what if we do.

192
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,120
If I put a delay in here.

193
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,220
And if I were to put here a thread.sleep,

194
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:01,590
that's gonna hold everything up until it
finishes sleeping.

195
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:04,140
So we wouldn't, we wouldn't see any
progress on the

196
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:06,330
progress bar because nothing's gonna

197
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:09,550
happen until this thread.sleep [UNKNOWN]
expire.

198
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:10,190
But if I put it.

199
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:17,150
Here in the run method of info later, it's
gonna achieve what we want.

200
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:23,600
So I will say if visible equals false, so
it's been set to disappear.

201
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,588
Let's have a little delay.

202
00:13:24,588 --> 00:13:30,450
Let's say thread.sleep and let's try 500
milliseconds and see how that looks.

203
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:34,070
I just handle the interrupted exception
there.

204
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:37,080
And I'll, I'll leave that as is.

205
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:43,580
It's not too important cuz it shouldn't
really be happening at the moment.

206
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:49,460
So, that's from this and click this and

207
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:55,120
now with a bit of luck, in fact that
perhaps wasn't quite enough.

208
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,120
Let's change it to 1,000.

209
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,480
I think that should work.

210
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,730
This all looks okay.

211
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:05,870
So sleeping just a little bit before
setting it invisible.

212
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:13,300
Let's run that and now my flips has got
slightly in my way.

213
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,360
Okay, let's go back to this, quit that.

214
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,440
Let's, made the console visible here.

215
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:26,770
Run the application and keeping my fingers
crossed here that this should work.

216
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:29,888
And, in fact, it doesn't.

217
00:14:29,888 --> 00:14:36,100
Because I don't actually know why.

218
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:43,510
yeah, because, we're calling setVisible
and I've got

219
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:45,540
this, I've got this set value equal to

220
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,240
null and so it's trying to hide the

221
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,360
progress bar and it's doing this, straight
away.

222
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,450
So I already want to get rid of that right
there.

223
00:14:52,450 --> 00:15:00,080
And I only want to set the progress to
zero if it's being shown on the.

224
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,460
It's being hidden.

225
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:04,680
Now I think we've nailed this, and I'd

226
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:08,350
really like to cuz progress bars are so
tricky.

227
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:08,820
There we go.

228
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,250
That looks much better.

229
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:10,870
Let's try this.

230
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:12,400
Okay.

231
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:15,130
Very nice.

232
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:17,380
Okay, so that's it for this tutorial.

233
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:17,930
And in the next.

234
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:22,940
In this tutorial, we're gonna look at
making this console button operational.

235
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:26,860
So join me again then and until next time,
happy coding.
