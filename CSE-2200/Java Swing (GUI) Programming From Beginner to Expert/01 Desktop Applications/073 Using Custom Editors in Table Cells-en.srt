00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:06,770
Hello, this is John from
caveofprogramming.com and in this tutorial

2
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:10,340
we're going to look at setting editors on
table cells.

3
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:15,360
So, I've already implemented a custom
renderer in the last tutorial here.

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,570
This employment category table cell.

5
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:23,245
And the employment category column
actually contains

6
00:00:23,245 --> 00:00:29,540
a norm constants and an enumeration class
I created.

7
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:33,710
And we're displaying this with this check
box, with this combo box.

8
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:37,100
But what I want to do now is make this
cell, these cells,

9
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,770
this column actually editable so we can
change the values in this combo

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,460
box.

11
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:49,330
So, the first thing to do is, so I'm gonna
go to my table panel here.

12
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:54,070
And I'm already setting a default renderer
for the employment category class.

13
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:59,190
And I'm gonna do a similar thing for the
editor.

14
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:03,385
I'm gonna say table.setdefault editor.

15
00:01:03,385 --> 00:01:10,220
And I'm gonna sa employmentcategory.class
which is the class of objects that's in

16
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:17,950
that stable column and then say new
employment category editor.

17
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:22,030
So, let's change from renderer to edit
all.

18
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:24,210
And that's what I've gotta implement in
this tutorial.

19
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,350
So, I'm just gonna copy that.

20
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:32,730
Save it, and I'm gonna now right click my
GUI

21
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:38,430
package and go to new class, let's paste
in the employment category editor.

22
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:46,740
And this has to implement, implement,
implements table cell

23
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:53,820
editor as you expect but since since table
cell editor has quite a lot of methods

24
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,130
table cell editor.

25
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:58,190
I think that's right.

26
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:05,680
Let's see, so I'll just click this error
message here and

27
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:11,360
because my renderer implements table cell
renderer, so the editor is gonna

28
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,920
implement table cell editor here, I don't
know why eclipse is being difficult there.

29
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,030
Okay.

30
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,670
But all's well that ends well.

31
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:20,560
Now the unimplemented methods, there's
quite a lot of

32
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,080
them as you can see and to get default
implementation.

33
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:30,140
So most of those I'm just gonna say,
extends AbstractCellEditor.

34
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,070
I've struck cell editor, which will give
me,

35
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:38,220
which will implement most of these methods
for me.

36
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,300
I'm gonna go to add unimplemented methods.

37
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,070
Well that didn't work, hang on.

38
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:48,340
Let's add the imput there and then save
that and add unimplemented

39
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:51,990
methods and then there are just two that I
have to implement now.

40
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:53,330
And I'm also gonna right click here.

41
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:58,110
And I'm not sure, actually, if this is
really strictly necessary.

42
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,990
But I'm gonna go to, is cell editable.

43
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:02,590
And let's return through there.

44
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,530
But this probably isn't necessary because
I'm gonna

45
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:08,270
fix this in my table model as well.

46
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:13,950
But, might as well, change this just in
case it makes a difference, I don't know.

47
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:17,900
And now, I'm going to use a combobox here
and if

48
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,629
you had kind of jazzed up your combobox in
your renderer.

49
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,730
And set the colors on it and things like
that.

50
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:29,370
You probably wanna have your renderer here

51
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,580
as a private variable, or something like
that.

52
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:35,440
And get the, get the convo maybe in the
constructor or this class,

53
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,220
from a renderer so you get the same combo
with the same colors.

54
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:42,890
But, in this case I'm just using a generic
combo with my renderer.

55
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,480
So I'll use a generic.

56
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,840
Editor as well.

57
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,400
Let's add a constructor here.

58
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:55,360
In constructor, I can say, combo equals
new J combo

59
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,470
box and in this case, since I want to
render an

60
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:03,990
enumerated type, I am gonna add some
values to my

61
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:08,330
combo box, just like in a renderer by
saying, implement category.

62
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:13,110
This is my enumeration type.values.

63
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:15,850
Which will get my my enumeration
constants.

64
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:20,390
And, you could add whatever values you
want in there, of course.

65
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,970
As long as they're consistent with what's
actually

66
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,690
in the table, or can be in the table.

67
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:28,708
So, n gets an editor, editor component,
I'm gonna return that combo.

68
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:37,710
In Get Cell Editor Value, I'm going to
return combo.getSelected item.

69
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:41,070
And finally, in getCellEditorComponent I
need to

70
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:44,900
say combo.setSelectedValue, just like in
the renderer.

71
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,240
setSelectedItem, sorry.

72
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,540
That's going to be set to value which is
this here.

73
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,810
The actual value of the table cell passed
in.

74
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:54,610
And I also want to add an actionListener
to

75
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:57,630
my combo like you do with buttons.So new
action.

76
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:06,020
I'll have an anonymous class here, where I
implement the action performed method.

77
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:11,070
Let's import action listener, and an
action performed method here.

78
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:16,180
And in here I just want to call fire
editing stopped.

79
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:21,270
That's really important, to tell your
table cell to stop using the editor and

80
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:26,550
go back to using the renderer and to
update the value in the table modeler.

81
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:30,120
Now we have a little bit of work to do in
the table model now.

82
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,780
I wanna make sure that in get column

83
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:38,860
class I am returning employment
category.class for the class.

84
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:41,680
I already implemented this in my renderer
so that's okay.

85
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:48,020
And I need to implement in

86
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:53,610
set value at so I need to say case four
'cause we're working on common four here.

87
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:54,790
Don't forget break.

88
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:59,360
That's very important, otherwise you'll
get strange errors.

89
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:07,550
And I'll say person.set untcut and pass in
the value there.

90
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:09,330
And I'll probably need to cast this

91
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:13,150
value to the enumeration type, employment
category.

92
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:17,270
So, I'm providing a set method to actually
set the value of

93
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:20,870
the data, otherwise my comment would work
but it wouldn't actually set the

94
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:24,500
value and as soon as you finish clicking
the combobox it would

95
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:28,510
display whatever value was originally in
the cell if you didn't implement this.

96
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:33,500
And in getCellEditable I also want to
return

97
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:38,240
true, to say that that column is editable.

98
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,530
And I think that should do the trick so if

99
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:44,010
I run this now, I've got this now,
editable comment box.

100
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:47,223
And if I set this to other, click save and
then click refresh.

101
00:06:47,223 --> 00:06:49,710
Still got a value over there just to prove
that.

102
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:50,250
Let's quit that.

103
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,566
And let's run it again.

104
00:06:52,566 --> 00:06:56,844
And we've still got other in there, but
I'm gonna set

105
00:06:56,844 --> 00:07:01,830
it back to employed, and maybe I'll set
this to other.

106
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,480
Hit save, just for some variety.

107
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:08,730
Okay, that's it for this tutorial, join me
again next time.

108
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:11,520
And until next time, happy programming.
