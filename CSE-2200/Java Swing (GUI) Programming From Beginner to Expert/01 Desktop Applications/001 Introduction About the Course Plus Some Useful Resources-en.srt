00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:04,440
Hello, this is John from
Caveofprogramming.com.

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,160
And welcome to the Cave of Programming

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:11,320
premium Java GUI Swing programming
tutorial series.

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:15,140
And in this series of at the moment 86
tutorials.

5
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:20,590
We gonna be covering [UNKNOWN] programing
in java swing, pretty much from scratch.

6
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:25,310
Well, absolutely from scratch all the way
to some really advance topics.

7
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:28,260
So, as long as you know some some java

8
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,360
you should be able to follow the series of
tutorials.

9
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,360
Now in the series we gonna look at
everything.

10
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:39,760
From creating database driven applications
like this one here, and

11
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,640
we're gonna take a look at JDBC connecting
to databases.

12
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:48,750
All the way to creating simple games.

13
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:52,420
So, we're gonna look at creating applets
as well that you can run

14
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:55,770
in a browser, and how you handle collision
detection and animation, and that kind.

15
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:57,540
Kind of thing and we're gonna look at

16
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:03,930
basically pretty much all the swing user
interface widgets

17
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:07,030
that you can use, convo boxes and trees

18
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:11,160
and top panes and dialog boxes, the whole
lot.

19
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:15,080
And this series of tutorials is structured
in such a way

20
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:19,490
that if you wanna know a particular topic
you can just look.

21
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:23,070
At that particular tutorial, and hopefully
will tell you what you want to know.

22
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:26,910
But if you also, on the other hand, want a
structured kind

23
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:29,350
of introduction to Swing programming, then

24
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:31,560
you can work through the tutorials
one-by-one.

25
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,510
Because they do follow one, one from the
other,

26
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:40,390
and we'll systematically build complete
programs, two complete programs.

27
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:42,750
In this series and we'll be talking about
how

28
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,190
to structure your code and we'll be
talking about

29
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:47,700
model view controller and all this all
these kinds

30
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:52,020
of topics that you'll need to successfully
build swing applications.

31
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:56,010
And I'll also touch on using visual
designer

32
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:58,840
incase you wanna design your applications
visually, but

33
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,680
with swing you really kind of need to know
what you're doing in terms of code.

34
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,498
And for that reason, most of the tutorials
are gonna be coding stuff by hand.

35
00:02:06,498 --> 00:02:07,590
And we're gonna be really digging into

36
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:10,110
the underlying concepts and see how
something works.

37
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,750
In this introductory tutorial I'm just
gonna show you

38
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,740
a few useful resources that you might
wanna know.

39
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:22,330
I'm just gonna tell you before that very
quickly a bit about my background.

40
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:27,298
I've been a software developer and now a
trainer for I don't know around fifteen,

41
00:02:27,298 --> 00:02:32,920
fourteen fifteen, years now and I've
worked for places like CSC.

42
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,770
Proquest, SBSS, AT and T, a whole bunch of
acronyms

43
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:41,830
and in this series of tutorials I'm gonna
share with you.

44
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:44,500
And pretty much everything I know about
swing programming.

45
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:48,040
So, hopefully you'll be able to
successfully create your own swing

46
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:54,050
programs, and even if you wanna go onto
other kinds of interface design using

47
00:02:54,050 --> 00:03:00,180
different technologies then Knowing how to
swing will stand you in good stead.

48
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:04,120
Because a, a lot of the concepts that you
find in swing are kinda

49
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,240
general software development concepts that
are used

50
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,840
in other kind of visual [UNKNOWN] systems.

51
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:15,100
Everything that we're gonna be using in
this series of tutorials is free.

52
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:19,990
And, and that includes Eclipse, Eclipse ID
for Java developers.

53
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:21,000
Which is a free download.

54
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,860
It's completely free to use and it's
pretty much the industry standard.

55
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:29,010
But if you wanna use a different IDE like
NetBeans or IntelliJ IDEA,

56
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:33,710
then you will find the stuff that you
learn here very, very trans, transferable.

57
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:36,628
You'll have no problem doing this stuff in
a different IDE.

58
00:03:36,628 --> 00:03:41,400
And we're gonna look at this window
builder pro GUI designer which

59
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,140
is a plug-in to Eclipse, you can also use
NetBeans for example.

60
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:52,130
Now, on to some useful resources for this
series of tutorials if

61
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:58,560
you go to Google and you search for window
window builder

62
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:05,060
pro, that's actually this is a product for
visually designing stuff that was.

63
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:07,340
Purchased by Google I think and released
as a

64
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:10,380
free designer, so you can find details on
that here

65
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:14,500
as an eclipse plug-in and that's, that's
very nice to

66
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,946
use, although you will, as I say, want to
learn.

67
00:04:17,946 --> 00:04:22,802
How to create swing swing components,
swing applications by

68
00:04:22,802 --> 00:04:27,670
hand as well to really successfully use
the visual designer.

69
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,850
And if you search for your clips ID for
Java developers, that will

70
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:37,020
give you a link to the IDE that we'll be
using throughout this series.

71
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:40,400
Of tutorials, IDEs, integrated development
environment, of course

72
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:52,770
and, some more useful resources are if you
search for visual guide swing components.

73
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:58,280
Then here you will get a link to all the
different visual swing components you

74
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:03,480
can use, and you get example code if you
click on any one of them.

75
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,890
And in the suitor tutorials we'll be
covering some

76
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,720
tips and tricks that you might not find
here,

77
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:17,090
but and this also really a hell of a lot
of stuff here in these in these examples.

78
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:19,180
That for reasons of time.

79
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,550
I haven't covered in the tutorials.

80
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:26,440
So, this is really good, resource to use
and you'll probably also want the visual

81
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:31,200
guide for to swing layouts because, to

82
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,840
arrange components in swing you use layout
managers.

83
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,890
And this shows you each one visually.

84
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:40,020
And again, you can click on the links to
get example code.

85
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:45,930
And finally, you will want to use the API
documents possibly

86
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:52,090
you may want to refer to particular API
documents in Java.

87
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:56,990
And swing is actual the user interface
toolkit that's built into Java.

88
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:59,125
So, if for example you type Jcombobox,
combo

89
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:07,040
box Java 7 and click on this link here.

90
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,980
You can find all the different methods and
all

91
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:12,240
the different things you can do with a
combo box.

92
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,728
And a lot of people are intimidated by
this documentation but.

93
00:06:15,728 --> 00:06:19,810
It is released for once you have a basic
idea of knowing what you're doing.

94
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:21,510
It gives you all of the different methods
you can use.

95
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:27,720
Okay, so that's it for this introduction.

96
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,920
And in the next tutorial, we're going to

97
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:34,390
get on designing our first Hello World
swing program.

98
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:38,783
So join me again then and until next time,
happy coding.

99
00:06:38,783 --> 00:06:41,814
[SOUND]
