1
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:02,070
Hi.

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:02,780
Welcome back.

3
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:07,180
This is John from caveofprogramming.com.

4
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:11,704
I hope you survived the last tutorial on
events, which was pretty complex.

5
00:00:11,704 --> 00:00:14,380
In this tutorial we're gonna look at
something a lot simpler.

6
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:17,839
We're gonna look at, list boxes.

7
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:21,100
So, I've created so far.

8
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,360
This application with this form here.

9
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,724
[SOUND] That just fills stuff in, here.

10
00:00:25,724 --> 00:00:28,662
And what I'm gonna do now is add a new

11
00:00:28,662 --> 00:00:32,410
control to this form, which is gonna be a
ListBox.

12
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:36,840
So, I'm gonna start by going to the class,
that represents the form here.

13
00:00:38,114 --> 00:00:41,762
and, I'm gonna add a new private instance

14
00:00:41,762 --> 00:00:46,840
variable type, [SOUND] JList, which is the
Swing ListBox.

15
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:53,174
And, [SOUND] I'm gonna make this ListBox
hold.

16
00:00:53,174 --> 00:00:59,450
Different age categories like under 18, 18
to 65, and over 65.

17
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:01,082
And so I'll call this ageList.

18
00:01:01,082 --> 00:01:02,511
[SOUND] And, let's go down to where I'll
add the input there.

19
00:01:02,511 --> 00:01:06,970
[SOUND] And let's go down to where if.

20
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:13,540
Created the other components and say
AgeList equals New DayList.

21
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:21,918
[SOUND] Now the Swing components in Java
they pretty

22
00:01:21,918 --> 00:01:27,173
much follow the, Model View Controller
architecture.

23
00:01:27,173 --> 00:01:34,100
So in the MVC architecture the view is The

24
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:37,390
literal, the actual GUI stuff like buttons
and everything.

25
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:39,570
Everything you see draw, drawn on the
screen.

26
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,680
The controller, in the case of our

27
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,120
application here, is, well a controller
is,

28
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,810
the part of the application that contains

29
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:50,340
all the logic, and that hooks everything
together.

30
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,058
And at the moment, this is really, [SOUND]
our main frame.

31
00:01:53,058 --> 00:01:54,780
Because that's.

32
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,520
Getting information from the different
components

33
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,340
and telling other components what to do.

34
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:03,020
And in this application here we haven't
got a model at all.

35
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:06,870
The model is the bit that stores data and

36
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:09,979
deals with data, deals with databases, and
so on.

37
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:13,820
But the upshot of this is, that if you
wanna add,

38
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:18,850
items to a JList, you gotta add stuff to
the JList's model.

39
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:22,233
And, [SOUND] what I will do here is I
will,

40
00:02:22,233 --> 00:02:27,622
create a default list model, [SOUND] which
I'll call AgeModel.

41
00:02:27,622 --> 00:02:32,653
And I'll set that equal to New
DefaultListModel like that and

42
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:37,680
at the import, and I can add items to this
AgeModel and to start

43
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,611
with I'm gonna just add simple string
items, and in the

44
00:02:42,611 --> 00:02:47,543
next tutorial we're gonna look at how
that, how you can make

45
00:02:47,543 --> 00:02:52,760
that, kinda hook that up with a database
and use ids.

46
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:56,460
These to represent your items instead of,
strings.

47
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,430
But, we'll keep it simple here.

48
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:03,260
I'll say AgeModel.addElement.

49
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:11,798
And the first elements gonna be a string
it says, let's say 18 or under.

50
00:03:11,798 --> 00:03:17,614
[SOUND] And actually, maybe that's not
exactly, typical.

51
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:20,430
Let's just say, actually under 18.

52
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:23,160
And I'll copy that.

53
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:28,728
And, I'll make a, [SOUND] two more items
here, and I'll

54
00:03:28,728 --> 00:03:33,845
have the middle category to be, 18 to
[SOUND] 65.

55
00:03:33,845 --> 00:03:39,223
And the last category here, I'll have 65
or over,

56
00:03:39,223 --> 00:03:45,090
[SOUND] and now I need to tell this
ListBox to use this model.

57
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:50,560
So I say ageList.setModel.

58
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,065
[SOUND] AgeModel.

59
00:03:55,065 --> 00:03:58,344
[SOUND] So now let's add that ListBox to
the form and then

60
00:03:58,344 --> 00:04:01,063
we can have a look and make it look a bit
nicer.

61
00:04:01,063 --> 00:04:03,446
So at the moment I've got, if I run this

62
00:04:03,446 --> 00:04:08,290
application I've got, three rows here
starting numbering at 0.

63
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:11,930
That's first row, second row, and last row
has a button in.

64
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:16,240
So I want the, ListBox to be before the
button on the third

65
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,530
row, and I want the button to be moved to
the fourth row.

66
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:24,958
So I changed this here grid y for the
button to be three, using

67
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:30,511
my, [SOUND] create [UNKNOWN] let's make
this comment, fourth row.

68
00:04:30,511 --> 00:04:36,059
[SOUND] Then let's just copy this, and
paste that in there.

69
00:04:36,059 --> 00:04:42,738
[SOUND] Say third row, [SOUND] and this is
gonna be, so grid wise gonna be two, and

70
00:04:42,738 --> 00:04:50,327
here instead of adding a button, I'm gonna
add the, AgeList and everything else.

71
00:04:50,327 --> 00:04:55,380
May be same ,now lets run this and see how
it looks.

72
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:59,970
And so this my ListBox oh yeah, actually
made the last

73
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:03,290
row take up all the space and don't want
this third row

74
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:06,170
take up lots of space and am gonna change
that width

75
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:10,650
by here to something that's more than the
final point 2 and.

76
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:12,100
Run that.

77
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,510
And that looks a, a lot better I think.

78
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,450
Now the this box here it doesn't look too
pretty.

79
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:20,480
So, I'm gonna, make it look prettier.

80
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,550
And the first thing I'm gonna do is set,

81
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:24,730
the preferred size to make it a bit
bigger.

82
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:30,621
[SOUND] So let's go up to where I can
create the, AgeList.

83
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:35,590
And so it's actually I'll go after here,
after I've set the data.

84
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:37,180
I don't think it really matters.

85
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:41,840
And I'll say
AgeList.setPreferredSizeNewDimension.

86
00:05:43,292 --> 00:05:51,061
[SOUND] And let's have it at, I don't
know, 110 and 66.

87
00:05:51,061 --> 00:05:53,926
[SOUND] You're probably gonna have to play
around with

88
00:05:53,926 --> 00:05:56,620
those figures, to get it to look, [SOUND]
really good.

89
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:00,499
But I think that looks acceptable and.

90
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,780
Let's give it a border.

91
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,510
Because it looks a bit strange without a
border.

92
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:13,899
So I'll say,
AgeList.setBorder(BorderFactor.create).

93
00:06:13,899 --> 00:06:17,842
[SOUND] Maybe etched border will.

94
00:06:17,842 --> 00:06:20,867
But good, I've missed a lot there though.

95
00:06:20,867 --> 00:06:24,320
For the factory.create edged order.

96
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:28,461
[SOUND] So, see how that looks.

97
00:06:28,461 --> 00:06:31,790
There we go, that's, quite a lot better I
would say.

98
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:39,085
And, Maybe just slightly, wider and now

99
00:06:39,085 --> 00:06:45,210
I wanna get information from this ListBox
when the OK

100
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:51,180
button is clicked and the way to do that.

101
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:55,930
Is, so in my action list on my button

102
00:06:55,930 --> 00:07:01,180
here I'm already getting information, name
and

103
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:06,180
occupation from the text fields and what I
can do

104
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:11,430
is I can say string, [SOUND] hcut let's
call it

105
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:17,065
equals, hlist.getSelectValue, like that.

106
00:07:17,065 --> 00:07:19,530
And that returns a, object.

107
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:23,910
So I need to put in a type cast here, from
object to string.

108
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:27,600
Because I know that the items in my
ListBox are actually strings.

109
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,885
Therefore, I can, definitely custom to
strings.

110
00:07:29,885 --> 00:07:34,192
And, if I do [UNKNOWN] out here to check.

111
00:07:34,192 --> 00:07:35,490
And it's always got to check as you're

112
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:39,020
going along, that things are behaving as
you expect.

113
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,900
Then, if I select one of those and click

114
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,700
OK that's gonna come out down here, in the
console.

115
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:52,180
I'm gonna, also select a default item when
the, this

116
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:55,510
box is created, cuz I think that would
look nicer too.

117
00:07:55,510 --> 00:08:02,043
So let's say here, [SOUND]
ageless.setSelectedIndex, and set it to 1.

118
00:08:02,043 --> 00:08:03,980
So, the first item is 0.

119
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:08,305
So, by setting it to 1, I set it to the
middle item like that.

120
00:08:08,305 --> 00:08:11,780
Yeah, I think it looks, better.

121
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:14,760
And now the next logical step here, will
be

122
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:20,080
to change the where is it, in my form
panel.

123
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,570
I've got this form event, class that
carries information to the main frame.

124
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:28,220
And the next logical information will be
to add in, the age category here.

125
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:31,259
But I'm actually gonna do that in the next
tutorial because.

126
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:38,870
Usually when you create a, ListBox, you
probably

127
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:41,860
don't want to get a string from it.

128
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:45,300
You probably want to get an ID that
represents that string,

129
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:50,720
because it's that ID that you will store
in your, database.

130
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,890
usually.

131
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:54,050
That's not necessarily the case, and I
could of course

132
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:59,568
here, I could, just use this AgeCategory
directly, and I could

133
00:08:59,568 --> 00:09:02,990
maybe have an if statement that looks at
the AgeCategory

134
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:06,490
and does different things, but as a
general principle, it's not.

135
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:06,990
Good

136
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,400
to have your the kind of, control that
aspect,

137
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:16,570
of your, application, the actual business
logic of it.

138
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:19,200
It's not good to have the logic, depending

139
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,250
on, things that are directly connected to
the view.

140
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:25,090
So if I change the wording.

141
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:28,117
Of my, age category, [SOUND] and if I were

142
00:09:28,117 --> 00:09:31,863
to change this, you know, to say something
like,

143
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:35,051
I don't know, over 65 instead of 65 or

144
00:09:35,051 --> 00:09:38,513
over, I don't want that to break my
application.

145
00:09:38,513 --> 00:09:42,349
And really, I wanna work with IDs here,
not direct with the

146
00:09:42,349 --> 00:09:46,260
strings, [SOUND] and so we're gonna look
at how to do that, in

147
