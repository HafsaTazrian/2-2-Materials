1
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:05,840
Hello, this is John from Cave of
Programming dot com.

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:09,890
And we're gonna take a kinda temporary
detour from looking at

3
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:15,390
swing in this tutorial just to look at the
serialization in Java.

4
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:16,870
And the reason I'm gonna do that is.

5
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:23,060
Just because, by building this,
application, which does quite a lot

6
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:29,500
already, but I want to have a way of
making these import and export data

7
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:35,720
items work so that I can store some test
data here that we can work with.

8
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:41,220
So that's why in this tutorial, I'm gonna
go over Saving objects to files

9
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:46,510
in Java and restoring them, even at that
small, strictly speaking, part of swing.

10
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:52,370
So, I'm going to start with the database
class

11
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:58,810
and which is part of my model here and I'm
gonna give this database

12
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:04,820
class, a couple of methods for, saving and
loading.

13
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:06,270
This array list of people.

14
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:13,310
So, I'll give it a method called save to,
to file.

15
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:19,630
Save to file will accept if I object if
it's in the argument.

16
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:22,359
That's the file that we actually want to
save to.

17
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:28,810
Let's have the import there, Java IO file,
and I'll make the import type void.

18
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:35,630
Now to actually do the saving, firstly
I'll create a file output

19
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:40,580
the stream, which I'll call FOS, and I'll
set that

20
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:46,070
equal to a new file, file output stream.

21
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:48,150
Which we're at the file.

22
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:54,020
And then, after I do the import, I'll have
an object output

23
00:01:54,020 --> 00:02:01,590
stream OOS equals new object output
stream.

24
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:05,000
And this is going to route the final
output stream off.

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,470
We got this kind of, rushed and dull thing
going on.

26
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:10,694
That's the [UNKNOWN] you always seem to
have

27
00:02:10,694 --> 00:02:12,800
and Java when it comes time things file.

28
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,160
And I'm going to use to object out of the
the

29
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,660
string to write my array list of people to
a file.

30
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:23,110
And after I've done that, I'll just call
OS dot close.

31
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:29,890
And I'm gonna throw from this method, IO
exception

32
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:32,250
because i want to handle it further up the
chain.

33
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:37,580
Now to actually write this array list of
people to this file,

34
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,789
there are various ways that I can do that.

35
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:47,320
And the way that I prefer, because it
avoids

36
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:52,930
warnings about, kind of, unchecked types,
and this sort of

37
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:55,180
thing, is to convert this arrays to people
to

38
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:58,010
an array list, and then write it to the
file.

39
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:07,810
So, I'm gonna say, person array, and I'll
just call that, I dunno, persons,

40
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:13,190
equals, and let's use people.

41
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:16,150
People dot two array.

42
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:21,040
And I'll use this version that returns a
array of the correct type.

43
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:26,920
So here I have to pass in a new, let's
copy that,

44
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:33,146
a new person array, of the correct length,
which is gonna be people

45
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:38,800
dot size, like this.

46
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,150
yeah, and if I've got this right, which I
have, that's gonna return a.

47
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:46,190
List of person, so you kinda create the
actual array there and

48
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:50,230
basically it's to array filter and then
returns a reference to it.

49
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,470
And then it's pretty simple to write that
to a file.

50
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,660
So all we have to do is say OS

51
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:59,850
dot Write Object, Write Object, and pass
in the arrayness.

52
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:04,990
Because an array sorry an array in Java
strange

53
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:08,670
though it may seem, is actually just an
object.

54
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,450
And if I, the advantage of, of doing it

55
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:14,488
like this is that if I've used the array
list.

56
00:04:14,488 --> 00:04:19,610
Here, people, and an array list, although
it

57
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:22,890
has the template type person, suffers from
erasia,

58
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:26,730
which is when you, not the eighties center

59
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:31,710
band, but actually if I had actually
written this.

60
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:37,200
This array list to to the file then it's
type, would've been erased.

61
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,519
And then when I restored it, I

62
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:43,610
would events property getting a unchecked
conversion warning.

63
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:46,020
Which I, I don't mind, so I prefer to do
it this way.

64
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:48,730
Anyway that's, that's not too important.

65
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:50,650
That's my, my [INAUDIBLE] here and let's
run.

66
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:53,230
Rightly loads from file method.

67
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:59,290
So public void loads from File File, File,
here.

68
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:05,190
And that's also gonna throw IO Exception.

69
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:16,635
And this time I'm gonna use a File Input
Stream FIS equals new file input stream.

70
00:05:18,065 --> 00:05:21,283
Now that's gonna route the file here, and
then I'm gonna have a, Oh.

71
00:05:21,283 --> 00:05:27,225
Get Input Stream dot OIS equals new Object
Input Stream.

72
00:05:27,225 --> 00:05:33,345
And that's gonna interrupt the File Input
Stream.

73
00:05:33,345 --> 00:05:35,100
And after I've noted objects.

74
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:35,510
From that.

75
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,190
I'm gonna do the OIS dot close.

76
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:42,730
That side, the imports are Control Shift
O.

77
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:48,530
And now I wanna restore from this object,
the stream by

78
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:52,690
array of that [UNKNOWN] cuz you see an
actual array in Java.

79
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:54,260
Does not suffer from erasure.

80
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:57,080
It remembers what type it actually is.

81
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:57,810
So let's say

82
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,640
OIS dot read object and I'm just gonna
read the one object.

83
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:10,140
And it's gonna be a personary of persons.

84
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:15,740
So let's just copy that, like this,
inputs.

85
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:19,670
And then, I can cast that to type.

86
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:20,350
That's an array.

87
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,360
And if I save that.

88
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:30,040
It's got a little arrow here.

89
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,360
Oh yeah, I've gotta also handle this.

90
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:37,340
Class not found exception, so if I do
surround a try catch there, and I'll

91
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:44,220
just do that in a moment, and once I've
got my array, I, I wanna

92
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:51,270
then set this people array, I wanna fill
it with the items from the array, and why

93
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:55,290
I'm importing thing, just for this little
application, is that I don't wanna change.

94
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,960
The array list that this is pointing at.

95
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,170
So I don't want to create a new array
list.

96
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:03,955
Because then I don't think about how to
get that array list back.

97
00:07:03,955 --> 00:07:06,930
Of the chain to my table model.

98
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:09,660
So I just want to rather create a new one.

99
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:13,050
I want to just add to this one, put items
into it.

100
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:16,540
So i'm going to say here equal.

101
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:21,360
Dot clear like this and then let's say
people dot

102
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,570
add all, and I want to add all the items
from this array but add all

103
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:31,640
doesn't take an array directly but there
is an arrays

104
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:37,720
dot, I think it's called, to list method.

105
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,660
Maybe it's called at, as, as list.

106
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:40,330
Let's see.

107
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:46,870
so, I'll have to pass in there the persons
array.

108
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:53,420
Let's add the important and in fact I
think it's called add list.

109
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:57,540
So what I've done is I've converted this,
persons array to

110
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:02,540
a list here and I've, added that list to
the array list.

111
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,920
List, of people, after clearing it.

112
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,670
So that's a little bit involved, but that

113
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:11,970
should basically take care of, saving, and
loading, the,

114
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:17,750
array of person objects, using
serialization in Java.

115
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,910
And if I wanted to save more data and load
more

116
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:23,520
data, of course I can, I could, then,
further go on.

117
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,400
To write more stuff after this.

118
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:30,950
And I could then load, more stuff after
this as well.

119
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:35,630
So you're not limited to just reading and
writing one object with serialization.

120
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:38,200
And, there's one important thing that I
must remember to

121
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,480
do otherwise I'll get an exception which
is that I must.

122
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,520
Make Person implement Serializable.

123
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:53,060
So if I go to public class person, I have
to say implements serializable.

124
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:56,990
Otherwise I'll get a I'll get an exception
being thrown.

125
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:00,720
When I try to serialize it, so.

126
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,820
So I'll add Java IO serializable and I
don't actually have

127
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:06,680
to add any new methods there, although
eclipse is gonna give

128
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:11,770
me a warning here about a generated serial
about a serial

129
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:14,500
version ID, I just, I'll just get it to
add that.

130
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:18,140
Just to shut it up.

131
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,930
Okay, I don't think we actually need that
there.

132
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:26,330
So let's save that, okay, the warning's
gone, so now I'm gonna just make the save.

133
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:28,960
To file a note from file methods work.

134
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:34,820
So firstly, I'll go to the controller,
which is here,

135
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:38,450
and because I've decided that in this
application, I want

136
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:43,310
more communication from the GUI package to
go through the

137
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:47,700
controller, I'm gonna just add rougher
methods in the controller here.

138
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:55,270
So public, Void save to file, and that
accepts file file,

139
00:09:55,270 --> 00:10:01,500
and all it does is it calls the db dot
saved file method.

140
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:06,500
And of course I also have to add the
throws IO exception

141
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:12,590
that it's at import file, and at throws
declaration.

142
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:18,713
Okay, and Sent in again for load so public
void load From

143
00:10:18,713 --> 00:10:25,440
file, file, file, let's type here throws
IO Exception.

144
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,808
And that's going to do db dot load.

145
00:10:30,808 --> 00:10:34,100
From file, file.

146
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:34,600
There we go.

147
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:40,280
And now finally, the, the last bit in this
chain here, chain

148
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:44,610
of method calls is if I go up to the,
where are you?

149
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:47,720
If I go up to the GUI here, the view, part

150
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:53,310
of the MVC architecture, model view
controller, and I go to

151
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:58,030
main frame here, then if I look down here,
I've actually

152
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:02,800
got a I've got a input data item and
export data item.

153
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,020
Item, menu item, which at the moment
aren't doing anything.

154
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:11,050
So let's make those work, let's say
controller, for import dot load,

155
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,840
controller, spell it right, that will
help.

156
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:19,720
Controller dot load from file and that's
going

157
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,800
to make set file chooser dot get select.

158
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:27,350
File which will return the kind of file
object that that user has chosen to load.

159
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:33,640
Let's delete that and let's handle the
exception there and surround with try

160
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:40,854
couch and what I'll do is if it can't load
the file, I'll say J.

161
00:11:40,854 --> 00:11:50,290
Option pain dot show message dialogue.

162
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:53,830
And then let's pass for the parents named
mainframe dot dis.

163
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,480
And actually don't want this.

164
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,100
Form of the constructor.

165
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,980
I want a more advanced one.

166
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,590
I have some more Humph.

167
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:07,370
This one I think.

168
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:11,020
So that's the message in here.

169
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:20,000
So load data from file or maybe let's say
failed.

170
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,790
Yeah, how about that.

171
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:26,120
Could, could not load the data from file.

172
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:26,657
How's that?

173
00:12:26,657 --> 00:12:29,940
And that's the title error.

174
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,160
That'll do actually, error.

175
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,786
And finally, message type, J Option

176
00:12:36,786 --> 00:12:42,060
Pane dot [INAUDIBLE] error, error message
there.

177
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:45,770
And I just do Control Shift F to format
that a bit.

178
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:51,190
Now the the save is gonna look pretty damn
similar.

179
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:51,290
So.

180
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:54,480
So let's copy that and put it in here.

181
00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:00,800
And except for, it's going to be load it's
going be save

182
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:08,180
not save from but save to file and let's
say could not save data to file.

183
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:13,240
And, apart from that it's all going to be
pretty much the same.

184
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,290
I'll just show you what that error message
[INAUDIBLE]

185
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:18,870
looks like here, so let's run this and go

186
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:25,120
to file, export data, and I'll export to
test

187
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,230
doc there and so that's what the message
looks like.

188
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:30,090
Could not save data to file, so it's
rather nice.

189
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:34,710
But I'll get rid of that for the moment
and let's see if this thing.

190
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,900
It works, I don't think I've gotten
anything, although

191
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:41,050
it is easy to make mistakes with
serialization, I find.

192
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:44,000
So let's run this here, now I've got
something which

193
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,119
is, when I actually load the data so we I
do.

194
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,080
For all we, so,

195
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:59,310
let's go up with it here and when I do
load from file, I've got to remember

196
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:04,070
to call table panel dot refresh,
otherwise, the

197
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:06,376
table panel won't know that there's more
data there.

198
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:11,130
And refresh method if you recall, in table
panel

199
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:14,630
just basically, let's take a quick look at
it.

200
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:21,810
We've got this, thin gui I've got a person
where are we table panel, there

201
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:26,810
we go, and that's just doing it's got the
refresh method it's called table model.

202
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:31,700
fire table dates changed and that tells it
table to

203
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,710
query the model again and get the latest
data from it.

204
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:38,120
So let's run this and see how it, how it
looks.

205
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,060
I'm gonna add, I'll add myself in there,
John.

206
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:42,010
Let's just say software for occupation,

207
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:48,150
I am self employed and not a US citizen.

208
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:48,900
So let's click okay.

209
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,080
And let's add another.

210
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:56,420
Person in there, let's say Sue, and let's
make Sue a

211
00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:01,890
manager, and let's say that she's employed
and she's a US citizen

212
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:07,270
with tax ID 1111, and she's female, let's
add her.

213
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:08,920
And actually I should really make it that
when

214
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,860
I click the okay button it clears the
form.

215
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:16,150
Could do very easily by saying the text on
these values next to

216
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:20,100
nothing, and resetting the selection, but
I'll leave that an exercise for you.

217
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:24,910
Let's go to file, export data, and I can
type the file name here.

218
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:27,890
I'll just use this test dot pair that I've
been using.

219
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:30,840
Click save, and now, if I go to.

220
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:36,200
To import data from test dot per,
hopefully there'll be no errors, and

221
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:40,840
just to prove that it works, let's quit
the application, run it again, and go to

222
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:47,560
file import data, test dot per and there
we are, we've got my data

223
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:53,300
back okay, so that's it for this tutorial,
as I say, not swing specific but.

224
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,890
But pretty damn useful so I thought it was

225
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:57,400
worth going over because it fits very much
into the

226
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,070
context of this application, and I wanted
to leave

227
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:03,140
you with an application that sort of, sort
of works.

228
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,070
And in the next tutorial, I'm gonna show
you

229
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:10,984
how to use pop up menus and we're gonna.

230
00:16:10,984 --> 00:16:14,030
Create a pop up menu that let's you just
delete

231
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:17,600
a row from this table, cuz at the moment
if I

232
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,790
do import data and right click on the
table, nothing happens

233
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:24,530
and we're gonna fix that, with a little
pop up menu.

234
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:29,010
So join me again next time, and until next
time, happy coding.
