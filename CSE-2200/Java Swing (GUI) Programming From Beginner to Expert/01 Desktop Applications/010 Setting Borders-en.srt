Hello there, this is John from
Caveofprogramming.com.

2
00:00:05,749 --> 00:00:09,720
And in the last tutorial I created this,
so there's a panel here, which I'm gonna

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,510
write the controls into, but in this
tutorial

4
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:15,090
I wanna give this panel a suitable border.

5
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:18,330
Now to give a component the border.

6
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:21,320
You can say set border, so I'm in a
constructor

7
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,840
of the form panel class here, which extend
straight panel.

8
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:26,950
And I could pass in there, I'm going to

9
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:32,490
use a static method of border factory
called create and

10
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,510
let's pick one of these methods and the
one

11
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:37,970
that I use is, all of these create
different borders.

12
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:43,662
But I use Create Titled Border and I'll
pass in a title at Person.

13
00:00:43,662 --> 00:00:49,330
This is gonna be a form for adding people
into some kind of database.

14
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:51,180
And if I run that it looks like this.

15
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:55,030
It's quite nice, except that because the
borders are so close to

16
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:57,980
the edges of the panel you can almost not
see the border.

17
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:04,670
So what I could do about that, is I could
add a second border around this border.

18
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:08,730
Which is just an invisible border that
just creates some space.

19
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:15,830
So I'm gonna start by taking this out of
the set

20
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:21,333
border called, and I'll say border inner
border,

21
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:27,180
equals, borderfactory.create, title
border, and

22
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:33,882
then I'll say border, outer border, equals
border factory,

23
00:01:33,882 --> 00:01:39,480
border factory.create.

24
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,950
And I want empty border here.

25
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:45,620
And I want to be able to specify the
margin all the way around.

26
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:49,770
Set our margin of five pixels for left,
right, top, and bottom.

27
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:54,910
And now to combine these two borders
together, and set

28
00:01:54,910 --> 00:02:00,210
border, I can pass border factory, top
create compound border

29
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:07,570
and I can pass that an outer border and a
inner border.

30
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:11,210
Inner border, which are the ones operating
already.

31
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:16,120
So if I run that you can see that now it's
indented a little bit.

32
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,640
It might be interesting to add a border to
my tool bar.

33
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,610
As well, let's just try that and see what
it looks like.

34
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,630
I might remove this again, though.

35
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:30,210
So, if I go to my tool bar, here in the
constructor of my tool bar.

36
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:33,860
I can say let's maybe put it here.

37
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:43,368
Set border, border factory.create, maybe
just edged border.

38
00:02:43,368 --> 00:02:46,320
Let's try that, let's see what it looks
like.

39
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:50,100
And there's also bevel, bevel borders and
things like that.

40
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:53,990
So now I got a border around my tool bar
which I may or may not get rid of later.

41
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:56,590
So that's borders for you and you

42
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,810
can experiment with different kinds of
borders.

43
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:03,480
Raised borders, lowered board, lowered
borders and so on.

44
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:09,610
And, and in the next tutorial we're gonna
have a look at text fields and labels.

45
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:14,570
So join me again, and join me again then,
and until then, happy coding.
