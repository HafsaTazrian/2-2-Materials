Hello, this is John from

2
00:00:03,105 --> 00:00:05,700
caveofprogramming.com and in this
tutorial,

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,000
we're just gonna look at setting the
cursor in Java.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,170
So, at the moment, I've got this progress
dialog that comes up.

5
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,330
And just as an example of setting the
cursor,

6
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:18,560
I'm gonna set the cursor to a wait cursor
when

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,940
the dialog is showing, and I'm going to
set it

8
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:24,740
back to the default system cursor when the
dialog's gone.

9
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:28,890
And it's very important, of course, to
restore the cursor after changing it.

10
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:33,720
So, in my progress dialog, I've got this
overridden set visible method.

11
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,800
And this is a good place, in this case, to
set the cursor.

12
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:42,310
So I'll say, if visible, we'll set the
cursor to a, wait cursor.

13
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,360
And if we're setting it to invisible,
we're hiding the dialogue, then I'm going

14
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:54,040
to set it back to the ordinary, to
ordinary cursor.

15
00:00:54,040 --> 00:01:00,560
So, here all you have to do is say, every
string component has a set cursor method.

16
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,670
And that's the one that we wanna use.

17
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:02,420
It's pretty simple.

18
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:09,410
And to set cursor you need to pass a
cursor, so I'm

19
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:15,800
going to say, cursor.getPredefinedCursor
and

20
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:21,550
then here I need to pass in a static int,

21
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:25,860
constant of the cursor class, and there's
a bunch you can use.

22
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:30,310
I'm going to use, wait cursor down here.

23
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:31,800
You can see from the auto complete there.

24
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,150
There's, there's quite a variety of
different cursors.

25
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,330
And when the dialog goes away again.

26
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:39,780
When visible is set to false.

27
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:50,050
I'm gonna call, set cursor cursor.get,
default cursor there.

28
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:53,640
And let's just take a look at that.

29
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,100
So now, when my dialog comes up.

30
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:01,400
I've got a wait cursor over the dialog.

31
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:06,890
Now, you might wanna set the wait cursor
over the

32
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:12,730
over your application as a whole.

33
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:14,310
In which case you need to call set cursor

34
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:19,430
for this jFrame or for, let's say, this
panel here.

35
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:25,049
But, for the moment, I content myself with
just having this wait cursor over

36
00:02:25,049 --> 00:02:30,280
the dialogue and, if you wanna set the
cursor elsewhere, it's very easy to do.

37
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:35,400
Just call set cursor on the appropriate
component or the whole frame if you want.

38
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,770
okay, so that's it for this tutorial.

39
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:43,460
Next time we're gonna look at nesting
nesting split panes.

40
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:44,550
So join me again then.

41
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:46,175
And until then, happy coding.

42
00:02:46,175 --> 00:02:48,504
