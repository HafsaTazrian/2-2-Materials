Hi there.

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:04,920
This is John from CaveOfProgramming.com.

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:10,530
And, before I go on to show you how to
cancel threads I just wanna, put

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:15,280
in a quick tutorial here about adding text
to progress bars because at the moment and

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,960
we've got this progress bar here, and
there's no text on it.

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,860
And you can actually out text to the bar
area it's self which is quite nice.

7
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:26,680
So to do that, it's really simple.

8
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:29,850
Let's go to the progress dialogue here.

9
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:37,860
And I'm going to say here,
progressBar.setString,

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:42,420
painted; it's kind of a strange name, but
you have to set string

11
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:47,050
painted true, and that will, put whatever
text you add to

12
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:52,410
the bar, it will, it will show, or paint,
if you like, that text.

13
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:53,790
And to actually show some text you

14
00:00:53,790 --> 00:01:01,790
say progressBar.setString and we can set
for example

15
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:13,790
retrieving mess, retrieve, retrieving
messages, like this.

16
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:19,650
And if we look at that gonna get,
hopefully from text from up here on

17
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:25,060
my bar retrieving messages and now often
what you wanna do is, make this

18
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:30,620
text update when, as the progress bar
progresses, so.

19
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:32,580
To do that I can say here.

20
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:39,050
Let's add say int progress equals

21
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:46,962
value divided by
progressBar.getMaximumValue.

22
00:01:46,962 --> 00:01:50,052
[INAUDIBLE]
maximum.

23
00:01:50,052 --> 00:01:52,660
And also, I'll multiply that by 100.

24
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:58,800
And let's also say,

25
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:04,550
just in case, maximum happens to be zero.

26
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:08,140
Well, actually, just to make sure that
this really can't be zero.

27
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,500
Let's go to start here and set

28
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:24,430
up here let's set progressBar.setMaximum
to 10 or something.

29
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:27,320
Although that's sort of theoretical
possibility

30
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:31,140
because actually you should never use the.

31
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:36,260
Progress bar as it stands without first
setting the maximum here otherwise the

32
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:42,650
progress value will be wrong anyways so,
okay, and now I can say

33
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:46,860
progress bar every time I set the father
view, I can say progressBar.setString.

34
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:50,420
And what string should we set?

35
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:56,885
Well I'm going to use, a static method in
the string class.

36
00:02:56,885 --> 00:03:01,600
String.format and this format string
slight print f,

37
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,650
if you know that and the way it

38
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,520
works is you pass them a format string

39
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,759
and specify how the string should look
followed by.

40
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:12,540
a, a series of parameters that will be

41
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,700
substituted into the format string, and in
this

42
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,560
case I just wanna use one parameter, the

43
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,280
progress value, the percentage progress,
and I want to

44
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:27,324
put an integer in here and Format code
[INAUDIBLE] % d and then a % sign and

45
00:03:27,324 --> 00:03:30,617
because % signs have a special meeting in

46
00:03:30,617 --> 00:03:35,509
these format strings, I need 2% signs,
which effectively

47
00:03:35,509 --> 00:03:37,220
escapes the % sign.

48
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:41,440
And if you, if you wanna, want more
information on string.format, just type it

49
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:47,270
into Google and look for it's API document
or you could look at system.out or

50
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:52,676
printf because that formats strings using
the same codes here, so let's say

51
00:03:52,676 --> 00:03:58,290
% complete, and let's just

52
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:03,630
run that and see if that works, so open
progress bar, and

53
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:10,410
there we go retrieving messages 33
complete, 60%, 100%, wonderful, okay

54
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:13,270
so that's it for this tutorial just a
brief one and.

55
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:16,030
In the next tutorial we're going to look
at cancelling

56
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:19,450
threads, and we're going to make that
cancel button actually work.
