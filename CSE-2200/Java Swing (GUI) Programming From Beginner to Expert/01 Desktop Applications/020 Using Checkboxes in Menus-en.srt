00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:05,420
Hello, this is John from
caveofprogramming.com and in

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:10,870
this tutorial we're gonna look at checkbox
menu items.

3
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:14,060
So if I run this App here, at the moment

4
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:17,715
I've got this there's this rather nice
menu up here.

5
00:00:17,715 --> 00:00:22,790
[UNKNOWN] doesn't actually do anything yet
and I've got this sub menu here and in

6
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:28,220
this tutorial, we're gonna change this
person form submenu into a check box

7
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:33,940
menu item and that's gonna show and hide
this person form here.

8
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:41,350
So I'll go to the main frame class here,
where I create my menu

9
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:47,570
and in addition to being able to add menu
items and menus

10
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:53,010
to to menus you can also add JCheckBox
menu items.

11
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:56,150
And there's also a JRadio menu item.

12
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:59,940
And here we're just gonna look at the
JCheckBox menu item.

13
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:05,430
The J Radio menu item works basically like
radio buttons and

14
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:08,090
you happen to [INAUDIBLE] and it's pretty
much all the same.

15
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:12,702
But I'll leave that as an exercise for you

16
00:01:12,702 --> 00:01:18,080
in the interest of keeping these tutorials
reasonably short.

17
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,940
So here I've got my, in fact, I've got my
window menu here.

18
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:29,420
And I'm, here, adding the show menu to the
window menu.

19
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:33,230
And the show menu I'm creating here.

20
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:38,710
And the show menu, I'm just adding a show
form menu item to it.

21
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:40,730
Which is actually just a menu item.

22
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:42,940
So if I go up to where I've declared that.

23
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:44,710
That, which is, yeah it's actually here.

24
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:52,980
And I'm gonna change this jmenu item to a
jcheck box menu item.

25
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,320
Let's add the import there.

26
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,020
And I'll change this variable declaration

27
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,379
although I'm not sure that actually
matters.

28
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:06,850
And now if I, yeah if I run that, you'll

29
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:08,540
see what it looks like already, I'm just
go to

30
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:10,990
window show and it's got that nice check
box there

31
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:14,000
which I can check, and I can uncheck it,
such magic.

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,660
And I can, I wanna set this initially to
checked so.

33
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:24,920
If I wanna actually use the methods of it,
so,

34
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:28,620
then I probably do need to change the
variable as well.

35
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,700
Variable name.

36
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:35,340
So, I'm gonna you set, select it and I'm
gonna set that equal to true, initially.

37
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:39,840
And now, in the last tutorial I mentioned
that you can now action

38
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,985
listeners to your J menu items and I'm
gonna add a action listener.

39
00:02:45,985 --> 00:02:47,520
I'm about to add my listeners here.

40
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:55,060
And I'm start with this this show form
item here.

41
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:59,480
So I'll say,
showformitem.addactionlistener.

42
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:07,630
And let's make that new ActionListener,
and, just the same as for button,

43
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:12,824
and implement the unimplemented
ActionPerformer

44
00:03:12,824 --> 00:03:19,430
[UNKNOWN] with CTRL+N and I'll get rid of
some lines here.

45
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:25,040
And now I can actually just

46
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:33,370
if I want to reference the show form item
here, in here, I could do,

47
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:38,400
I could just make that final, or I could
also just get it from this event here.

48
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,190
So I could say event.get.

49
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:43,520
source, like this.

50
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,090
And I know the source in this case is
gonna be

51
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:51,690
a JCheckBox menu item, because that's what
I've added the listener to.

52
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:58,490
So I can pass that to that and, and I
could create a variable here.

53
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:03,510
menu, let's just call it menu item.

54
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:09,100
Equals and then I can say I wanna

55
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:14,600
show or hide the the person form.

56
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:21,270
So this mainframe has a bunch of instants,
variables, and one of them says form

57
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:26,670
panel that contains the form that I've
been working on in the last tutorials.

58
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:32,370
So I'm gonna just say, form panel.set
visible.

59
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:34,500
And this also works with dialogues.

60
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,650
By the way.

61
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:36,850
You can show an enlight dialogues.

62
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:39,460
Which we'll look at later using set
visible.

63
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:42,674
And I'll just say that is eq, that is

64
00:04:42,674 --> 00:04:48,780
visible or invisible depending on menu
item dot dot.

65
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,060
Is selected.

66
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:51,735
There we go.

67
00:04:51,735 --> 00:04:56,081
[SOUND] So just in case that was a bit
confusing here,

68
00:04:56,081 --> 00:05:01,547
I've chosen just to show you an alternate
way of doing this.

69
00:05:01,547 --> 00:05:07,420
I've got the menu item from the source of
the event here.

70
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:11,480
But I could just have used, this is
basically

71
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,780
pointing to the same place as this
variable here.

72
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:17,740
And if I declare this variable final here,
in other

73
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:20,930
words constant, I could have just
referenced that directly here.

74
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:22,830
But oh sorry not there.

75
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:24,230
Of course, that's where I'm using it.

76
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:28,310
But where I declare it, so here, I could

77
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:29,980
declare that final, and that would enable
me to.

78
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:30,870
Let's reference it in here.

79
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:36,370
Just mention it in case you're not too
familiar with, a

80
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:41,238
kind of referencing stuff from methods of
anonymous classes like this.

81
00:05:41,238 --> 00:05:44,855
So, anyway let's run that, and now

82
00:05:44,855 --> 00:05:47,630
[INAUDIBLE] window menu, and then go to
show.

83
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:50,950
That's ticked because I set it to selected
to start

84
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:54,490
with, but if I untick then my forum is
gone there.

85
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:58,240
It's rather nice, and if I tick it again
then it's back.

86
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:58,740
There you go.

87
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,610
So and that's the first tutorial.

88
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:06,500
You can also add icons to a menu.

89
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,430
But in the next tutorial we're gonna take
a look

90
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:16,730
at mnemonics and accelerators, which is
not completely menu specific.

91
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:18,920
But it's very useful stuff to know.

92
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,920
So join me again, then.

93
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,910
And until then happy coding.
