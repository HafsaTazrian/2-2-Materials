00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:05,584
Hello, this is John from
caveofprogramming.com and in this

2
00:00:05,584 --> 00:00:09,770
tutorial we're gonna look at radial
buttons in Java Swing.

3
00:00:10,832 --> 00:00:16,390
So, in a moment I've got this nice little
form here and.

4
00:00:17,638 --> 00:00:20,625
In the last tutorial we added this check
box here.

5
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:24,580
And in this tutorial I'm gonna add some
radio buttons down here.

6
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:26,430
Now, radio buttons are a little bit more

7
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:31,580
complex than check boxes, but, nothing you
can't handle.

8
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:35,118
So, I'm going to have check boxes here.

9
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:40,980
That represent gender, so, to keep

10
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:47,060
things nice and simple, simple, I just
have two alternatives, male and female.

11
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:50,000
And I'm gonna start by creating my radio

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,590
buttons here, so I'll say private jradial
button.

13
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:57,660
And just to repeat what I said in the last

14
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:04,090
tutorial right here buttons allow you to
choose mutually exclusive options.

15
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:10,210
So if you have options you can select
together you want check boxes.

16
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:12,040
But if you got to pick one option from

17
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:16,030
a bunch of several you want radial buttons
so let's.

18
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:22,297
And call this male radial and then I'll
and then I'll create another

19
00:01:22,297 --> 00:01:28,280
one called, start the import there, J
radial button female radial.

20
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,360
So I'm just gonna have two of them.

21
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,580
And you also need a button group.

22
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,770
To use with radio buttons.

23
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:41,610
So I'll say private button group and
gender group.

24
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:46,230
And button groups are what allow you to
group

25
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:49,030
the buttons together, so that you can say
that

26
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:50,930
if one of them is selected, then the other

27
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:55,670
should be deselected automatically, which
is the usual behavior.

28
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:57,260
Off radial buttons.

29
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:02,036
So now, lets go down here and say
maleRadial = new

30
00:02:02,036 --> 00:02:07,980
JRadialButton and I'll give that some text
by the side of it.

31
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:08,390
Put it there.

32
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:14,700
It says male, and female radial = new
JRadialButton.

33
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,015
Female, of course, female.

34
00:02:18,015 --> 00:02:26,252
[SOUND] And I'm gonna add those to the
button group, so I'll say here.

35
00:02:26,252 --> 00:02:27,450
Gender group.

36
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:31,400
Equals new button group.

37
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,870
And notice it's button group and not j

38
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:37,000
button group, which I think it's because
this.

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,030
I think this comes from the AWT, the

40
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:42,740
previous Window toolkit that used to exist
in Java.

41
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,240
I'm not sure.

42
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:49,440
So let's settle the gender radials here.

43
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,917
Set up gender radials.

44
00:02:51,917 --> 00:02:59,511
[SOUND] And I'm gonna start by adding
those two radial buttons.

45
00:02:59,511 --> 00:03:01,490
To the button group.

46
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:07,749
So I'll say genderGroup.add maleRadial.

47
00:03:07,749 --> 00:03:14,500
And genderGroup.add, femaleRadial.

48
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:19,270
And now let's go ahead now and add those
to the form.

49
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:22,630
And we'll see a couple of little problems
come up, which we can then fix.

50
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:29,250
So, I'm gonna add the radial buttons on to
rows here.

51
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,320
So let's copy one of these rows.

52
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:35,790
And here are the male radial.

53
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:39,770
And I'm gonna put a label by the side of
that.

54
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:42,430
On the left there that says gender.

55
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:51,280
And then, on the next row, that should be
new JLabel, new JLabel.

56
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:55,595
On the next row, I'm gonna add the next

57
00:03:55,595 --> 00:04:00,190
radial button, so let's go down here,
paste this.

58
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:02,780
And don't need a label for that, so I'll
get

59
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:10,170
rid of that and I'll say, female add the
female radial.

60
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:11,310
There we go.

61
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:13,630
So, if I look at that now one

62
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,960
obvious problem is that these are really
widely spaced.

63
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:22,040
And that's just the, spacing on my, my
grid layout,

64
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,640
so let's go to where that, where I have
that

65
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:28,410
mail radial and reduce the weight y for
this particular

66
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:33,048
row, so let's set it to something really
small like 0.5.

67
00:04:33,048 --> 00:04:34,597
0.05.

68
00:04:34,597 --> 00:04:38,300
So that looks quite a lot better.

69
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,250
And this label looks a bit misalighned.

70
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:44,060
I'm not paying too much attention to these
labels as I go through.

71
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,950
Cuz fiddling with the labels takes a huge
amount of time.

72
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,260
And it's a matter of taste.

73
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:53,870
But I will just fix this gender control
because it looks really ugly.

74
00:04:53,870 --> 00:05:00,060
Let's go to, Here, I just change it from
first line end to line

75
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:05,780
end so it aligns in the middle of the row,
so that looks a little bit better I think.

76
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:10,070
Now neither of them are selected at the
moment, so let's go up here

77
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:15,970
and, I'm gonna go to the male radial here.

78
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:20,350
And I'm gonna set it to selected by
default.

79
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:24,110
So maleRadial.set, selected true.

80
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:31,890
And if I run that, then I got male
selected and if I select female, because

81
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:37,069
they belong to a button group, selecting
one de-selects the other as I want.

82
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:43,320
Now the next interesting challenge here is
how to find out which one is selected.

83
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,300
And by the way, it's worth mentioning, you
absolutely

84
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,420
can not add action list on to radial
buttons.

85
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,640
But I won't do that here, I want

86
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,180
to actually get information about which is
selected.

87
00:05:54,760 --> 00:06:01,020
At the, at the end so to do that the first
thing I'm going to do

88
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:07,225
is, I'm going to do, male.

89
00:06:07,225 --> 00:06:11,530
Radial dot add action, actually not add

90
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:17,200
but set action command and set action
command.

91
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,410
Let's do set a string that you can

92
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:23,420
then retrieve from the button with get
action command.

93
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:26,244
So I'm going to set this equal to male

94
00:06:26,244 --> 00:06:29,570
and this is, this is separate to the label
here.

95
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:33,340
This is some text for kind of internal
purposes.

96
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:38,856
And let's do the same thing with the
female radial here so female

97
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:44,080
radial.set action command female and now
what I can do is.

98
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,450
If I go to that, the action listener on
the button.

99
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:51,730
So down here, this is where I'm collecting
all my data.

100
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:52,620
I can say

101
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:01,280
I can say string gender command equals.

102
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,200
And, I can use the button group, so gender
group dot.

103
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:10,780
Get selection.

104
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:16,350
And that's gonna return the button, the
radio button that's well

105
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:19,960
it's gonna return actually the button
model of the radio button.

106
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,680
And on that I can do get action command.

107
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:26,060
Like this, so that's gonna return male
female.

108
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:29,040
And of course I could do a dot equals on
that string here

109
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:33,040
and change it to a boolean, if I wanted,
or something like that.

110
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:39,500
Let's just put gender in here, and let's

111
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:45,750
go to, if I click on form event and go to,
and hit F3, in eclipse, so I

112
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:48,860
can go to the declaration of it and here I
can say String

113
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:55,360
gender and just do the usual stuff like
here, so private, private string.

114
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:01,159
Gender and this.gender equals

115
00:08:01,159 --> 00:08:08,410
gender, and I could supply it with a get
gender of course so if I go to source

116
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:15,200
and generate get this inserters, and I can
have a just a getter for.

117
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,610
Gender.

118
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:18,660
Okay, so there we go.

119
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,462
And just to show you that working, let's
maybe

120
00:08:25,462 --> 00:08:29,110
oh yerah, I've got, let's change
genderCommand to gender actually.

121
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:30,090
That makes more sense.

122
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,499
And in the main frame, of course, I could.

123
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:42,080
Where I receive the event I could make use
of gender some how, if I wanted.

124
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,600
So, I don't know, let's just do a sys out
for the moment.

125
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,270
So, if I.

126
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:51,560
I've got this form event being seeped
here.

127
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:59,231
So I could say e.getgender now' cause I've
just added that method get, e.getgender.

128
00:08:59,231 --> 00:09:06,700
And if I run that you're gonna see the,
when I select one of these buttons

129
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:13,589
and click okay then it's gonna say, female
or male just according to what I select.

130
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:17,970
So, if I don't touch it, then it's gonna
be male and there's

131
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:22,020
my string, of that app, to previously
which I'm just gonna remove, actually.

132
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:26,850
Okay, so, Yeah, that's that.

133
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:31,510
So like in the next tutorial, I'm gonna
take a break from looking at all these

134
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:36,930
different form controls, you'll be pleased
to know, and I'm gonna look at menus.

135
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:39,920
So we can look at the j menu control.

136
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,640
So join me again then, until next time,
happy coding.

137
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:47,069
