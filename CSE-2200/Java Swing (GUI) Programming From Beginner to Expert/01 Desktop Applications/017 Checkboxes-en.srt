00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:02,336
[NOISE] Hi, welcome back.

2
00:00:02,336 --> 00:00:06,185
This is John from Cave of Programming dot
com

3
00:00:06,185 --> 00:00:11,180
and this is a tutorial on check boxes in
swing.

4
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:18,432
So, I'm going to start here by declaring a
check box so.

5
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:24,400
J Check Box, and actually

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:30,680
I'm gonna make this a check box that, you
tick to say that you

7
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:36,760
are a US Citizen, so I'll call it Citizen
Check and I could.

8
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:41,840
To just get the get whether this check box
is selected

9
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:47,290
by calling the E selecting method and I
could just pass that back

10
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:52,640
to my main frame but to make this a little
bit more interesting I'm gonna

11
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:58,290
actually have this check box enable or
disable a text field

12
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:03,200
which is gonna be J text field and

13
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,600
its gonna be called tax field.

14
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,100
So if you tick the check box to say your a
US citizen.

15
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,790
You have to enter a tax ID.

16
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:18,477
So let's go down here and I'll, I'll set
Citizen

17
00:01:18,477 --> 00:01:23,930
Check equal to a new J Check box here, new
J Check box.

18
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:30,448
And I will set tax field equal to a new J

19
00:01:30,448 --> 00:01:36,640
Text field with a width of ten characters.

20
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:42,470
And now in in the constructive to your
check box

21
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,090
you can actually supply some text so
several different constructors.

22
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:51,250
You can supply text and you can say
whether

23
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,880
it's initially selected or deselected, but
I'm not going

24
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,850
to use those parameters here because I'm
just going

25
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:00,080
to put a label by the side of it.

26
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:04,590
And, and I'm also going to put a label by
the side of my tax field, and I want

27
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:08,270
my label to also appear grayed out if the

28
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:13,390
citizen chat box is not ticked along with
tax field.

29
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:18,924
So I'm going to add my label for tax field
up here, so J label

30
00:02:18,924 --> 00:02:24,459
and tax label, so let's call that, and
here I'll set

31
00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:30,105
tax label equals new J label, and now I'm
going to do a little

32
00:02:30,105 --> 00:02:35,899
bit of init setup, well actually apply the
tax as well so say.

33
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,920
here, tax ID.

34
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,420
And

35
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:47,400
let's set up, set up, tax ID.

36
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:54,870
So, I'm gonna start by making the tax
label disabled.

37
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,480
So I'll say set enabled.

38
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,220
False.

39
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:03,410
And I'm also gonna make the tax field, not
enabled either.

40
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:06,680
So it's gonna appear grayed out and you're
not gonna be able to enter stuff in it.

41
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:10,480
And then, to the citizen check here, which
is

42
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,850
gonna be initially deselected, I'm gonna
add an action listener.

43
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:18,380
So add action listener just like a button.

44
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,500
So, I'll say new Action Listener.

45
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:22,150
Listener.

46
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:24,430
And.

47
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:30,460
Add a semicolon there and add an
implemented method here,

48
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:36,840
and just get rid of some, some of this
extra stuff here that I don't need.

49
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:44,150
And what I do is, so this will be invoked
whenever the citizen check box is.

50
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,010
Ticked or unticked.

51
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:49,710
And I wanna firstly get whether

52
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:54,832
that text field is selected or not, so I
can say

53
00:03:54,832 --> 00:04:01,760
boolean is ticked, let's say,

54
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:08,460
equals and it's gonna be citizen check.is
selected.

55
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:08,730
There we go.

56
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:11,040
So that will get me true or false,

57
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,580
depending on whether this is ticked or
not.

58
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:19,690
And if it has just been ticked I will
enable the tax label in the tax field.

59
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:20,920
And otherwise I'll disable them.

60
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:28,030
So I'm gonna say tax label dot set enabled
is ticked like this.

61
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,510
And tax field.

62
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,798
Dot set enabled.

63
00:04:30,798 --> 00:04:38,432
[SOUND]
Is tacked.

64
00:04:38,432 --> 00:04:38,950
Okay.

65
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:41,770
Now let's add those controls to the form.

66
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:45,549
So I'm gonna go down, I'm gonna go down
here to where I do the layout.

67
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:50,150
And so the last row's the button.

68
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:52,280
I'm just gonna copy the row before the
button here.

69
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:00,290
And here I'm gonna add in my my check box.

70
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:02,550
So let's add in here citizen check.

71
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:04,880
And let's add.

72
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:11,603
A label here which I'm gonna just make it
say, US,

73
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:18,000
US citizen.

74
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,410
So if I run that let's see what it looks
like.

75
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:24,070
You see it says US citizen, I can take
this.

76
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:24,950
Looks rather nice.

77
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,310
Let's copy this again.

78
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:30,550
And, it's the row underneath it.

79
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,420
So now, I'll add in the text field.

80
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:32,920
And,

81
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:39,000
so I'm gonna use here, for the label.

82
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,730
I'm gonna use the tax label control that
I've just set up.

83
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:44,600
And.

84
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,380
Here I'm gonna add the text field.

85
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:51,640
So, if I run that, you can see it's
disabled.

86
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,610
But if I tick this, I can't enter stuff in
it.

87
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:58,490
If I tick this, then it is enabled, like
that.

88
00:05:58,490 --> 00:05:59,990
I can disable it again.

89
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:00,760
It's rather nice.

90
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:06,260
And of course I can, so that's basically.

91
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:12,410
If move check boxes, I'm just gonna add,
gonna modify my form

92
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:17,970
event to store some further information,
and you're probably pretty familiar

93
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:24,020
with this by now, so if you get a picture
with

94
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:27,610
the form events, then feel free to skip to
the next tutorial.

95
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:35,060
I'm gonna add here a Boolean US citizen,
US citizen,

96
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:41,470
and I'm gonna work this rather long
constructor.

97
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:44,200
Let's just do control shift F to format
that

98
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:49,636
bit and then I'm gonna say here string tax
ID.

99
00:06:49,636 --> 00:06:54,090
And Boolean US citizen.

100
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:57,930
US citizen.

101
00:06:57,930 --> 00:06:59,240
Like that.

102
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:04,330
And let's just do this dot tax ID equals
tax D.

103
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,900
And this dot US citizen.

104
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,480
Equals US Citizen.

105
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:17,450
And I can add a get methods for those.

106
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:22,090
So let's just add to use the eclipse short
cut.

107
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:26,670
Right click here, go to source and...

108
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:28,080
Generate getters and setters.

109
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,020
And I wanna generate getters and setters
for

110
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:34,790
these in fact, probably don't really need
the setters.

111
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:39,050
That's just expand that, and get rid of
that.

112
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:43,200
And if you have a Boolean variable, then
you can see Eclipse is

113
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:48,740
generating a is US citizen, rather than
get US citizen, which is quite common.

114
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:51,040
A reasonable thing to do.

115
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,510
So that's that.

116
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:57,040
If I wanted, of course I have, to modify
the events here.

117
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,050
Let's do a format on that as well.

118
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:03,060
And then I can add, here.

119
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:11,450
So, to actually get the value from the
check box I need to use selected method.

120
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:18,704
So I'll add in here, the this should be
string tax ID.

121
00:08:18,704 --> 00:08:24,348
D equals tax field dot get, that's

122
00:08:24,348 --> 00:08:29,826
pretty simple and Boolean US citizen,

123
00:08:29,826 --> 00:08:35,809
citizen equals and that's just gonna be.

124
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,380
The name of the check box.

125
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,890
Which I've forgotten.

126
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:45,827
I think it's, citizen check right?

127
00:08:45,827 --> 00:08:50,380
citizen check dot is selected.

128
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,040
There we go.

129
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,990
And so I'm just gonna write these in here.

130
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,440
So tax Id and US Citizen.

131
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,500
And I can do something with that
information later.

132
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:03,960
But for now, I'm not gonna worry too much
about it.

133
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,520
So I could add it in her, for example.

134
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:11,030
and, ok so that's it for this tutorial.

135
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:14,930
And in the next tutorial, we're gonna look
at radio buttons.

136
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:20,420
So check boxes are great if you have a
bunch of options and you can

137
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:24,620
tick any combination of the options or you
just have one, as in this case

138
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:28,540
but sometimes you have a bunch of options
and you can only select one of

139
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:31,010
them, they're mutually exclusive and for
that

140
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:35,500
situation you use radio buttons not check
boxes.

141
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,390
So we're going to look at that in the.

142
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:38,190
Next tutorial.

143
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:40,789
And until then, happy coding.
