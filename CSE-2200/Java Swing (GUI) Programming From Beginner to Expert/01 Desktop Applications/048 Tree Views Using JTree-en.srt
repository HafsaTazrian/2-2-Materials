00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:04,600
Hello this is John from
caveofprogramming.com.

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:08,361
And in this tutorial we're gonna start
looking

3
00:00:08,361 --> 00:00:13,542
at the very interesting and quite complex
JTree component.

4
00:00:13,542 --> 00:00:18,989
So in a moment, if I run this program,
what it looks like is this.

5
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:21,260
And I've got this tab pane here.

6
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:25,550
And I can just paste stuff in this table.

7
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:29,258
And I'm going to start working now on this
messages tab.

8
00:00:29,258 --> 00:00:31,312
And this is going to have like a tree here

9
00:00:31,312 --> 00:00:35,320
that's going to allow us to select
different message servers.

10
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:39,600
And then we're going to have a list of
messages for all the servers selected.

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,800
And then at the bottom we're going to have
actual message text.

12
00:00:44,092 --> 00:00:48,790
So to start with, I'm going to create a
panel to put my tree in here.

13
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:55,550
So let's go to GUI, the GUI package, and
say New Class.

14
00:00:55,550 --> 00:01:00,700
And I'll make this a I'll call this
Message Panel, Message

15
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:05,560
Panel, and this is gonna extend j panel,

16
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:08,380
like this.

17
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:13,161
And add the imports there and I'm just
gonna

18
00:01:13,161 --> 00:01:16,430
add, I'm gonna go to my, let's save that.

19
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:26,214
I'm gonna go to my main frame here and
let's create a private message panel.

20
00:01:26,214 --> 00:01:29,306
Message panel.

21
00:01:29,306 --> 00:01:30,846
Message panel.

22
00:01:30,846 --> 00:01:33,960
Call it lowercase m.

23
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:40,589
And before I add this before I create the
tree the type pane, and get the types to

24
00:01:40,589 --> 00:01:43,364
work, and up here, I want to create a

25
00:01:43,364 --> 00:01:47,949
message panel, so message panel equals new
message panel.

26
00:01:47,949 --> 00:01:50,782
And I'm just going to add this to the

27
00:01:50,782 --> 00:01:55,320
type instead of this text panel, so
message panel here.

28
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:59,390
Now in the message panel, I'm gonna start
with, I'm

29
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:02,420
just gonna create a tree, so you can see
the tree.

30
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:05,570
So I'll say public message panel, give it
a constructor.

31
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:08,480
Let's set a layout here.

32
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:12,201
Let's just use, for the moment, I'm just
gonna

33
00:02:12,201 --> 00:02:16,640
use a new border layout that's gonna
change later on.

34
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:23,090
And I'm gonna give messagePanel a instance
of JTree.

35
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:27,559
So private JTree tree.

36
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,660
And let's call that server tree.

37
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,460
Cuz this is going to be like a

38
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:36,700
tree of different message servers that you
can select.

39
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:43,220
And then the constructor here, I'll create
a new, I'll say server tree

40
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:49,300
equals new JTree like this.

41
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:53,090
And down here, I'll add this tree.

42
00:02:54,212 --> 00:02:57,140
For the moment that's the onle component
in the message panel.

43
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,870
So I'll say add.

44
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:05,122
Now when you add a tree, to a panel or
whatever you almost

45
00:03:05,122 --> 00:03:09,810
always wanna wrapped it in a JScroll pane,
in fact let's say we always do.

46
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:14,090
So let's say, yeah, add new JScroll pane.

47
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:16,490
I'm not sure if it even works properly

48
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:19,510
without this scroll pane so let's set that
in.

49
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:21,310
Server tree.

50
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:26,022
And let's set that up BorderLayout.center.

51
00:03:26,022 --> 00:03:30,810
Add the imports and then let's have a look
at.

52
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,310
Well that's not gonna look like anything
at the

53
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:36,040
moment, because I've not added any nodes
to the tree.

54
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,650
In fact, well, actually I'm quite
surprised.

55
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:42,810
I've never tried this before, but
apparently this is the fault j tree.

56
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:43,520
And that's what it looks.

57
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,220
But we're gonna change that now.

58
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:50,390
And, so to, to create a tree you need

59
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:56,170
to create a Basically a tree consists of
leaves and

60
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:59,310
nodes and all the leaves and all the nodes

61
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:03,990
are all default mutable tree node, I think
it's called.

62
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:06,590
So all these, this is a node, this is a

63
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:09,960
node, this is anode which is a leaf as
well.

64
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,850
And they're all default mutable tree
nodes.

65
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:14,380
So we need to create the hierarchy.

66
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:22,350
And I'm gonna create a private method here
that returns a default mutable tree node.

67
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:23,640
mutableTreeNode.

68
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:27,000
I hope I've got that name right.

69
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,500
And I'm going to call this createTree.

70
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,660
Like that.

71
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:37,120
Let's add the brackets on there at the
input.

72
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,610
Is ticket right name so that's good.

73
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:45,080
And I'm gonna say here tab new JTree.

74
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:50,182
I'm gonna say in here createTree.

75
00:04:50,182 --> 00:04:54,705
And here I'm gonna create a

76
00:04:54,705 --> 00:05:00,890
DefaultMutableTreeNode which I'll call top
or you could call it Root.

77
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:07,665
And I'll set that equal to a new
DefaultMutableTreeNode.

78
00:05:07,665 --> 00:05:09,940
And let's give that some text in a
constructor.

79
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:10,980
Let's say service.

80
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:18,840
And under here, let's create a hierarchy
which has two branches underneath the top.

81
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,470
So I'll say I'm getting sick of typing
that so I'll copy it.

82
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:28,230
And say Branch1 equals new

83
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:33,750
DefaultMutableTreeNode and let's set that
equal to USA.

84
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,450
And this is gonna be service in the USA.

85
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:42,090
And I'll have the same thing again so
let's just copy that and we'll have this.

86
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:46,670
We'll make this service for the UK and
I'll call it Branch2.

87
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:54,470
Now to Branch1, I"m gonna say Branch
one.add.

88
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:56,911
In fact, I'm going to create some under
here.

89
00:05:56,911 --> 00:05:59,500
Let's create some leaves.

90
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:03,240
So these are going to be the tips of the
branches, so to speak.

91
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:08,940
So let's say DefaultMutableTreeNode, leaf

92
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:14,780
conserver1 equals new
DefaultMutableTreeNode.

93
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:18,880
And let's call that, let's name that
London.

94
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:23,289
Oh, it's in the USA so let's call it New
York.

95
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:28,960
And I'm going to repeat this several
times.

96
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,714
Let's have a couple for the USA, let's
say.

97
00:06:31,714 --> 00:06:39,340
So let's have New York let's have Boston,
and also let's have Los Angeles here.

98
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:42,570
So, Los Angeles.

99
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:47,184
And call it server1, server2, server3.

100
00:06:47,184 --> 00:06:49,920
And we'll have the same for the UK.

101
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,620
Servers here.

102
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:55,440
So, we just have a couple there.

103
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,669
So server, call that four and five, and
let's

104
00:07:00,669 --> 00:07:06,180
make this London and let's make this
Edinburgh.

105
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:08,570
Edinburgh.

106
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:14,772
Okay, so now I'm gonna add, I'm gonna, I'm
gonna

107
00:07:14,772 --> 00:07:19,950
add this service, the USA service to the
to branch1 here.

108
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:27,405
So I'll say branch1.add and then server1.

109
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,410
And let's repeat that through the service.

110
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:33,310
So I'm building a hierarchical structure
here.

111
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:35,530
So two and three.

112
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:40,488
And then let's go to branch2 here.

113
00:07:40,488 --> 00:07:42,916
That's my UK one.

114
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:51,552
I'll say branch2.add and server4.

115
00:07:51,552 --> 00:07:53,590
And of course you could build up this
structure

116
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:55,847
from data retrieved from a data base or
something.

117
00:07:55,847 --> 00:07:58,920
But here I'm just going to do it kind of
by hand.

118
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,130
Make the data by hand and show you how it
works.

119
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:05,640
So let's say top.add and I'll say branch1.

120
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,640
Yeah branch1.

121
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,150
And top.add.

122
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:13,594
I probably should have called that
location1, location2.

123
00:08:13,594 --> 00:08:14,960
It doesn't matter.

124
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,110
Branch2.

125
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:24,910
Okay, and now finally we return the top
mutable tree node from createTree.

126
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:27,130
So you see the strategy is to build up
default

127
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:29,340
mutable tree nodes and to add them to each
other,

128
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,790
add them to each other and add in the kind

129
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:34,260
of structure that you need to build up
your tree.

130
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:38,090
And the lower ones will be leaves of
course.

131
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:44,310
So now that I've done that let me just
ponder what I've done with this.

132
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:45,806
Why am I getting an error?

133
00:08:45,806 --> 00:08:49,410
I've probably got a, oh yeah, I've
actually put this in the wrong place.

134
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:50,670
This is outside the class.

135
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:54,040
Let's cut that and put it in the right
place.

136
00:08:55,475 --> 00:08:57,390
Ctrl+Shift+F to format a bit.

137
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:58,810
That always helps.

138
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:06,461
And so now, so when I create my tree, I
pass in the route note.

139
00:09:06,461 --> 00:09:09,463
[UNKNOWN] the other notes to the route
note in the right structure.

140
00:09:09,463 --> 00:09:14,790
And I add in my tree t the panel wrapped
in the scroll pane.

141
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:17,240
I'm just using bod layout, yeah, because
I'm just

142
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,780
starting it, it's the only component for
the moment.

143
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:24,100
And now if I run that, with a bit of luck,
see we've got this tree with servers.

144
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:30,120
And we've got USA New York, Boston, Los
Angeles and two UK servers there.

145
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,279
So that's it for this tutorial.

146
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:35,920
In the next tutorial, we're gonna look

147
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:41,710
at responding to selection events in the
tree.

148
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:45,080
So join me again then and until next time,
happy coding.
