00:00:02,030 --> 00:00:02,390
Hello.

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:04,820
This is John from caveofprogramming.com.

3
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:09,270
And in this tutorial, we're gonna look at
the JToolbar class and

4
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:13,360
we're gonna make this toolbar up here look
a bit more interesting.

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,210
So at the moment I've got text on my
buttons as well as icons.

6
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:23,800
So often what you what is a tool bar like
this one here, that just has icons on it.

7
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:30,020
Now if I go to my tool bar class here,
which is actually a kind of J panel,

8
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:36,676
and I remove the text from the buttons
like this, [SOUND] and run that.

9
00:00:36,676 --> 00:00:38,568
They actually look a bit rubbish cuz
they're

10
00:00:38,568 --> 00:00:40,970
rectangular and it doesn't really look
like a toolbar.

11
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:44,140
And I'm gonna fix that now.

12
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:46,373
And one thing I'm gonna do to start

13
00:00:46,373 --> 00:00:49,688
with actually, is I'm gonna add tool tips
there.

14
00:00:49,688 --> 00:00:57,377
So I'm gonna say,
saveButton.setToolTipText save.

15
00:00:57,377 --> 00:01:06,732
[SOUND] And, I'm also gonna say
refreshButton.setToolTipText.

16
00:01:06,732 --> 00:01:07,508
Refresh.

17
00:01:07,508 --> 00:01:13,312
[SOUND] And you can use set tool tip, text
or any kind of buttons anywhere

18
00:01:13,312 --> 00:01:18,584
and you then get these tool tips that come
up, which is rather nice.

19
00:01:18,584 --> 00:01:25,430
Okay, now I'm gonna change this J panel
into a toolbar.

20
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:27,840
So I'm gonna say, search J panel here.

21
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,240
I'm gonna say extends JToolBar with
capital B and I'll add

22
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:38,640
the input there and I'll get rid of, the
set layout thing here.

23
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:45,050
And to add buttons to a tool bar you just
call ads, and a button name.

24
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:51,020
And sometimes you wanna make a separator,
between two groups of buttons.

25
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:53,725
And then you could say add separator.

26
00:01:53,725 --> 00:01:59,298
[SOUND] And if I run that now, you can see
that the buttons are square.

27
00:01:59,298 --> 00:02:02,102
And I've got a separator, just a blank
space between them.

28
00:02:02,102 --> 00:02:04,560
I'm gonna get rid of the separator because
it doesn't look

29
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,050
that good in this application because
there are only about two buttons.

30
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:11,420
and, and now I've [UNKNOWN] like that and
they've got tool tips as well.

31
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:14,810
And, they should still work.

32
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:15,310
There

33
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,470
you go.

34
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:22,320
And, now you can make the toolbar
draggable as well.

35
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,890
If you want.

36
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:28,990
And one thing that I need to do, is get
rid of this border here.

37
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:36,130
And if I, if I run that, it's gonna be
with a bit of luck trackable.

38
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:38,370
So, it, in a moment, I can, you

39
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:41,440
can actually drag it completely out of the
application.

40
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,740
And you can fix that if you want.

41
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:45,980
But I'm having trouble here docking it.

42
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:50,230
And I think that's because, when you add,
toolbar.

43
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:51,540
If I go to MainFrame here.

44
00:02:52,670 --> 00:03:00,120
You need to add toolbars using where are
we, so we've added it using.

45
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,280
Let's look for the border layout.

46
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,220
Here we go.

47
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,380
I've added it using BorderLayout.North.

48
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:08,303
But, you, you need to add it using
page_start like that,

49
00:03:08,303 --> 00:03:13,260
and you also wanna be careful about what
other components you're adding.

50
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,319
So here I've got a FormPanel to the West.

51
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:22,500
And that will stop my toolbar docking to
the west, so to speak.

52
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,960
But, I think I can still dock it here.

53
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,710
There we go.

54
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:28,930
On the right.

55
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:31,080
So we're gonna drag and drop the toolbox.

56
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,326
It's quite difficult to get [UNKNOWN].

57
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,770
Here at top sometimes.

58
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,760
And okay, I think that's just about it for
this tutorial.

59
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:45,500
If you don't want your toolbar to be to be
floatable.

60
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,740
If you don't want it floating.

61
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:53,460
Then say set floatable, false and then if
I run this.

62
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:59,880
It's no longer, gonna be actually even
dragable, and

63
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:04,750
you can also like there's nothing stopping
you setting borders around your toolbar.

64
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:08,140
But, if you set a too, a border around the

65
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:14,790
toolbar, it's not gonna be not usually
gonna be draggable so.

66
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:17,280
And these have it with not bother, it's
draggable.

67
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,397
But actually I'm, I'm not really convinced
in

68
00:04:20,397 --> 00:04:23,740
the value of draggable tool bars on the
whole.

69
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:28,070
I actually quite like the look of it with
set border.

70
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:32,185
let's just put a comment here.

71
00:04:32,185 --> 00:04:39,129
Get rid of the border if you want the
toolbar draggable.

72
00:04:39,129 --> 00:04:43,009
[SOUND] Okay, so that's it for this
tutorial.

73
00:04:43,009 --> 00:04:48,377
And in the next tutorial, we're gonna look
at splitter windows,

74
00:04:48,377 --> 00:04:52,676
so join me again then and until next time,
happy coding.

75
00:04:52,676 --> 00:04:52,747
