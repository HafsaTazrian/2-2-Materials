00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:06,720
Hello, this is John from Cave of
Programming and,

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:12,180
this is, a tutorial of creating two balls
and slim.

3
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:13,724
So, we're just gonna look at a

4
00:00:13,724 --> 00:00:17,040
really, really very basic toolbar, in this
tutorial.

5
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,307
So, in the last tutorial we, we created
this little

6
00:00:20,307 --> 00:00:23,205
app here, [SOUND] and if you click a
button [SOUND]

7
00:00:23,205 --> 00:00:25,731
it just outputs a low there and what I
want

8
00:00:25,731 --> 00:00:28,428
to is to have this button in a tool bar.

9
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:32,774
[SOUND] So, at the moment the structure of
this application now is,

10
00:00:32,774 --> 00:00:37,905
I've got a very, very simple main
application that just does new MainFrame.

11
00:00:37,905 --> 00:00:43,621
I've got a MainFrame class and the
MainFrame cr, creates two components,

12
00:00:43,621 --> 00:00:48,380
a button and a text panel, and it adds
them to itself.

13
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:52,139
And it listens to the button, and, when
you click the button, it.

14
00:00:53,288 --> 00:00:57,931
[SOUND] sends a command to the, text area,
the text panel.

15
00:00:57,931 --> 00:01:00,004
And I've also got this text panel
component.

16
00:01:00,004 --> 00:01:04,354
Basically it's a JPanel with a scroll pane
embedded in

17
00:01:04,354 --> 00:01:08,700
it and a text area embedded in the scroll
pane.

18
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,252
[SOUND] Okay then, so let's take a look.

19
00:01:11,252 --> 00:01:16,130
What I wanna do is, create a new class for
start, that's gonna be the tool bar.

20
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:19,540
So this is a, this is a new, custom
component.

21
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:23,703
So, I'll go to, I'll right click and go to
new, class

22
00:01:23,703 --> 00:01:27,709
[SOUND] and, or I could go to file menu
and do new class.

23
00:01:27,709 --> 00:01:33,475
And I'm gonna call this, [SOUND] toolbar,
and once again, as last time,

24
00:01:33,475 --> 00:01:38,869
as in the last tutorial, [SOUND] I'm gonna
make this extend the JPanel

25
00:01:38,869 --> 00:01:44,186
class, so click Finish, so public class
toolbar extends JPanel.

26
00:01:44,186 --> 00:01:47,235
Let's add in the import.

27
00:01:47,235 --> 00:01:56,198
And to get this a constructor, set public
[SOUND] toolbar like this.

28
00:01:56,198 --> 00:01:59,094
Now if I go back to my MainFrame class,

29
00:01:59,094 --> 00:02:03,350
I can already add a panel instead of the,
button.

30
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:06,569
And I wanna add it at the top, of course,
instead of the bottom.

31
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:14,192
So let's, here, create private [SOUND]
private variable of type toolbar.

32
00:02:14,192 --> 00:02:17,675
[SOUND] And I'll call it toolbar.

33
00:02:17,675 --> 00:02:25,073
And, here [SOUND] I can say toolbar in the
constructor, tool bar equals new tool bar.

34
00:02:25,073 --> 00:02:28,371
[SOUND] And then down here,.

35
00:02:28,371 --> 00:02:33,474
I can, just where I'm adding the
components, I could just, have a new add.

36
00:02:33,474 --> 00:02:34,856
I can say add.

37
00:02:34,856 --> 00:02:40,470
[SOUND] Now if I copy that first, Ctrl+C,
Ctrl+V.

38
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:44,986
[SOUND] I can say, add toolbar
atBorderLayout.north.

39
00:02:44,986 --> 00:02:47,484
[SOUND] To add it at the top.

40
00:02:47,484 --> 00:02:50,910
Now if I run this now I'm not gonna see a
whole, a whole lot.

41
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:53,951
Because, this panel's automatically sizing
to almost

42
00:02:53,951 --> 00:02:56,368
nothing because there's nothing in it yet.

43
00:02:56,368 --> 00:03:01,385
[SOUND] So, let's fix that I'll go into
the toolbar and let's

44
00:03:01,385 --> 00:03:05,156
add two buttons to the tool bar to be
going on with.

45
00:03:05,156 --> 00:03:12,947
[SOUND] So, let's have a private a private
J button and I'll call this.

46
00:03:12,947 --> 00:03:17,709
Because I'm not quite sure what this
application's gonna do at the moment.

47
00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:21,120
It's just demoing, the kind of theory of
it really.

48
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,810
I'll call this button one.

49
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,910
Well, let's call it anobutton.

50
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:25,410
How's that?

51
00:03:26,804 --> 00:03:32,422
And then, [SOUND] I'll have a private
JButton, [SOUND] Goodbye button.

52
00:03:32,422 --> 00:03:33,471
Goodbye button.

53
00:03:33,471 --> 00:03:37,252
[SOUND] And of course, I wanna say in

54
00:03:37,252 --> 00:03:42,766
the constructor, that the HelloButton =
new JButton.

55
00:03:42,766 --> 00:03:46,723
[SOUND] Let's give it some text, or label,
Hello.

56
00:03:46,723 --> 00:03:53,636
And the goodbyeButton = new
JButton(*GoodBye*).

57
00:03:53,636 --> 00:03:58,744
[SOUND] Sounding a bit like a Paul
McCartney song, but nevermind.

58
00:03:58,744 --> 00:04:01,990
Okay, and, and now I wanna add those
buttons.

59
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:03,571
To the, toolbar.

60
00:04:03,571 --> 00:04:06,973
And, I'm gonna use something called flow
layout

61
00:04:06,973 --> 00:04:10,942
because I don't wanna use boarder layout
here on

62
00:04:10,942 --> 00:04:13,858
this panel, because I don't wanna add the

63
00:04:13,858 --> 00:04:17,680
button at their North South center East to
West.

64
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,560
And you can only add one com, component.

65
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,400
Each position there.

66
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:26,010
What I wanna do is I wanna add them, kind
of from left to right.

67
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:28,460
And this say, layout manager does that.

68
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,406
And it's called, flow layout.

69
00:04:30,406 --> 00:04:35,796
So we're gonna do set layout, [SOUND] new
flow layout.

70
00:04:35,796 --> 00:04:39,670
And as I mentioned in their introductory,
tutorial.

71
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:44,336
If you, set your visual guide swing
layouts, you'll find

72
00:04:44,336 --> 00:04:48,610
a guide to different layouts and you'll
find this, among it.

73
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:52,330
So if you set flow layout, all you have to

74
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:57,630
do is do add just add your components
without, like this.

75
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:06,078
And add, [SOUND] Goodbye button, like so.

76
00:05:06,078 --> 00:05:09,772
And now if I run this now, I got two
buttons that are right in the middle.

77
00:05:09,772 --> 00:05:13,341
[SOUND] And to get them over to the left,
I can pass

78
00:05:13,341 --> 00:05:18,529
an argument to the constructor, the flow
lay out, lay out manager.

79
00:05:18,529 --> 00:05:22,159
I can use flow lay out.left, like this

80
00:05:22,159 --> 00:05:27,680
and that's gonna align my, components to
the left.

81
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,670
And by the way, you might wonder if you
can get

82
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:33,900
flow, flow layout to add components,
vertically and the answer is no.

83
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,660
I don't know why not, but there you go.

84
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,676
So if I run that, now I've got two

85
00:05:38,676 --> 00:05:42,637
buttons on the toolbar that's beginning to
look, rather nice.

86
00:05:42,637 --> 00:05:45,370
It doesn't do anything, yet my old button,
still works.

87
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:50,646
Now I wanna change these so that I wanna
get rid of this button down here and

88
00:05:50,646 --> 00:05:54,741
I wanna make it so that if I, if I click
this button here, it outputs hello here.

89
00:05:54,741 --> 00:05:59,157
And if I click this, it outputs, Goodbye,
in this text area.

90
00:05:59,157 --> 00:06:06,147
And to do that we're gonna have to tackle,
one of the key, key things in, swing

91
00:06:06,147 --> 00:06:13,270
development, which is creating a listener
and listening to a, a custom component.

92
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,420
I'm gonna show you a very simple

93
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:18,470
technique, to do that in the, next
tutorial.

94
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:23,330
So, join me again then, and until then,
happy coding.

95
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:23,380
[SOUND]
