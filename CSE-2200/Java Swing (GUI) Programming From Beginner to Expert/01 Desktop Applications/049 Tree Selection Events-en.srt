Hello, this is John from
caveofprogramming.com, and in this

2
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:10,210
tutorial we're gonna look at responding to
tree selection events.

3
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:13,786
Now one thing I'm gonna do here is, at the
moment in my tree here.

4
00:00:13,786 --> 00:00:19,010
I can Shift+Click to select, or Ctrl+click

5
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:24,320
to select more than one tree node, and
responding to tree selection events

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,240
only makes sense, if you can only select
one node at a time.

7
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:34,190
And for that reason I'm gonna select the
selection mode on the tree here.

8
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:43,090
I'm gonna say server tree is the name of
my JTree component .getTreeSelectionModel.

9
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:48,607
getTreeSelection, .getSelectionModel,

10
00:00:48,607 --> 00:00:55,033
actually .getSelectionModel, and
setSelectionMode.

11
00:00:55,033 --> 00:00:59,869
I'm gonna ask that static constant from
the class,

12
00:00:59,869 --> 00:01:05,109
TreeSelectionModel there and I'm gonna
set, and that's,

13
00:01:05,109 --> 00:01:10,166
I'm gonna used that constant
SINGLE_TREE_SELECTION.

14
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:13,144
So once it's doing is it's quite complex.

15
00:01:13,144 --> 00:01:14,801
So I've got the selection model,

16
00:01:14,801 --> 00:01:17,610
and called getSetSelectionMode on the
selection model.

17
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,900
And then pass that tree selection model,
that SINGLE_TREE_SELECTION.

18
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,530
And what that does is now, if I look at

19
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:29,140
my tree I'm holding down Ctrl here, but I
can only

20
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:32,760
select one node at a time, and that's what
I

21
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,740
want, because otherwise what I'm about to
do won't make sense.

22
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:37,980
And later on, we'll look at, a much

23
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:40,820
more flexible way of dealing with tree
selection.

24
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:46,560
But for now, I'm gonna to say now, we're
going to ask to serverTree,

25
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,496
I'm gonna to say addSelection, actually I
think it's that

26
00:01:51,496 --> 00:01:57,360
TreeSelectionListener part about it, and
let's add a semicolon in there.

27
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,900
And here I could make

28
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:02,180
MessagePanel implement
TreeSelectionListener but instead

29
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:06,786
I'll just use an anonymous parse here I'll
say, new TreeSelectionListener.

30
00:02:06,786 --> 00:02:12,480
Round brackets, Scala parenthesis and
implement the missing methods here.

31
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,930
And, this will be called every time
someone selects a node in the tree.

32
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:24,808
And, when you do select a node in a tree,
I'll say ServerTree,

33
00:02:24,808 --> 00:02:31,480
that's my JTree,
ServerTree.getLastSelectedPathComponent.

34
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:35,200
And so I have to select, set this to
single tree selection

35
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,930
cuz otherwise there's not gonna be one
unique get last selected path component.

36
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,995
And that component is gonna be a

37
00:02:42,995 --> 00:02:49,540
DefaultMutableTreeNode, so it's actually
gonna return an object.

38
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:53,630
Because I've only added
DefaultMutableTreeNode into my tree.

39
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:55,955
So it's gotta be a DefaultMutableTreeNode.

40
00:02:55,955 --> 00:03:01,451
So set that equal to, see this returns a
object, i'm

41
00:03:01,451 --> 00:03:06,470
gonna cast it to default mutable tree node
here.

42
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:09,484
Because I know that's what it will
actually be,

43
00:03:09,484 --> 00:03:11,841
cuz that's what my is tree made up of.

44
00:03:11,841 --> 00:03:20,109
And when I've done that I can say
nodes.GetUserObject, user object.

45
00:03:20,109 --> 00:03:24,975
And you might wonder what the user object
is, and the answer is, it's

46
00:03:24,975 --> 00:03:29,679
whatever you passed the constructor of
DefaultMutableTreeNode,

47
00:03:29,679 --> 00:03:32,832
and in this case my user object strings.

48
00:03:32,832 --> 00:03:38,722
So I can say string, userObject equals,

49
00:03:38,722 --> 00:03:44,673
cast it to String, node.getUserObject.

50
00:03:44,673 --> 00:03:50,458
And actually, let's not see it's going to
be a string, let's just say

51
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:56,514
Objust userObject, this maybe more
eloquent, equals node.getUserObject.

52
00:03:56,514 --> 00:04:02,857
And then, all I'm going to do here is sys
out on the user OBJECT.

53
00:04:02,857 --> 00:04:08,467
So now if I run this, and I go to my tree,
and I select something, select

54
00:04:08,467 --> 00:04:14,290
service, you can see it's, it's got the
text service down here, USA, UK.

55
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:17,890
And if I expand those I can click on these
individual ones

56
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:22,910
and now the console is getting the string
associated with the, nodes.

57
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,340
so, Now that's all very well, but it's not
terribly flexible.

58
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:33,585
And, and for that reason, in the next
tutorial

59
00:04:33,585 --> 00:04:38,800
we're going to look at associating data
with tree nodes.

60
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,850
So we're gonna look more closely at these
user objects.

61
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:46,458
So join me again then, and until next
time, happy coding.

62
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:50,520
