1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:06,165
Hello, this is John from
caveofprogramming.com.

2
00:00:06,165 --> 00:00:11,080
And this is a tutorial on just, wiring the
database code that

3
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:16,010
we've been creating in this series of
tutorials into the swing application.

4
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:19,647
So there, there isn't gonna be any new
really new stuff here.

5
00:00:19,647 --> 00:00:22,197
It's just I'm gonna take stuff that I've

6
00:00:22,197 --> 00:00:25,230
been showing you and bring it all
together.

7
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:30,330
So I'm gonna change this application so
that this is gonna be a save button.

8
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:34,030
So you can save the stuff the people
you've got

9
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:38,120
here in this pane and, and the table into
the database.

10
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,350
And this is gonna be a refresh button.

11
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:44,910
So that if you click refresh it's
basically gonna reload the

12
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:49,850
contents of the data base into the, into
the table pane here.

13
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:56,490
So, to start with, I'm gonna go to my
Mainframe.

14
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:01,530
And let's search for hello because I want
to change the names of these buttons.

15
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:04,020
And let's have a look.

16
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:08,520
So, in fact the buttons are named in this
Toolbar.java.

17
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,660
And later on we're gonna look how to use a
JToolbarController.

18
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:13,900
But for moment I'll stick with this.

19
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:17,740
So, this is gonna be called save.

20
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:20,780
And this is gonna be called Refresh.

21
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:32,290
Now I wanna make it so that when you click
save it takes everything in the

22
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,310
in that table.

23
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,960
As I save, it saves it to the database.

24
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:43,350
So I wanna make a make this raise in
event,

25
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:49,230
that tells the mainframe that save has
been clipped.

26
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:51,635
And at the moment all it's doing is

27
00:01:51,635 --> 00:01:56,745
what it's doing is, this is text listener,
thing.

28
00:01:56,745 --> 00:02:01,770
To the toolbar, you can set textListener
on the toolbar, and that

29
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:10,420
has a textEmitted method, which the
toolbar calls for when you click a button.

30
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:12,122
And this, this is kind of wildly an

31
00:02:12,122 --> 00:02:14,430
appropriate name for I really want to do
here.

32
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:18,080
So the first thing I'm gonna do is go to

33
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,590
this textListener and change it to some
other kind of listener.

34
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:26,540
So I'm actually you know, wondering why,
why the hell I

35
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,870
called it textListener if I want you do in
the first place.

36
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:32,215
Let's go to the declaration of this.

37
00:02:32,215 --> 00:02:33,890
Oh yes it's a stringListener.

38
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:39,090
And it's declared in this interface here.

39
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:43,600
So now let's, I'm gonna right click on
that and get to Source.

40
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,850
Actually it is Refractor my new entry and
clips,

41
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,820
I'm gonna rename this stringListener to
something more appropriate.

42
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,886
Let's just call that, let's call it

43
00:02:52,886 --> 00:02:55,740
ToolbarListener which would make a lot
more sense.

44
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,760
So, and I click Finish there.

45
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:05,270
And instead of textEmitted, let's refactor
that, rename it to

46
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:07,860
let's see.

47
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,160
Well this is gonna be an event

48
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:13,740
that's raised if something happens in the
toolbar.

49
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:20,922
So, let's call this well this can be call,
called

50
00:03:20,922 --> 00:03:26,430
saveEventOccurred really,

51
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:31,059
and this method could be called if you
click the Save button in the toolbar.

52
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,710
I'm seeing if that's really a good name
for it.

53
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:36,340
Yeah, let's, let's go with that.

54
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,290
Doesn't matter too much.

55
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:46,365
And let's also give it a public void
refreshEventOccurred.

56
00:03:46,365 --> 00:03:50,850
And we don't need really to have any
string text in there either.

57
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:54,357
So these are just gonna be two methods
that call

58
00:03:54,357 --> 00:03:57,584
in response to the Save and Refresh
buttons being clicked.

59
00:03:57,584 --> 00:03:59,163
So I think that'll do the trick.

60
00:03:59,163 --> 00:04:01,145
And now let's have a look in the toolbar

61
00:04:01,145 --> 00:04:04,530
here and see if we've gotten any problems
in there.

62
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:09,982
So, later on, we call saveEventOccurred,
if this Hello button is clicked,

63
00:04:09,982 --> 00:04:15,367
so, I'm, I'm gonna change that, let's give
it a text hello and goodbye.

64
00:04:15,367 --> 00:04:19,750
And if you click the Goodbye button, okay
now, have a refresh again.

65
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,700
I'm gonna rename these these buttons.

66
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:27,210
So instead of helloButton, I'm gonna go
with Refactor > Rename.

67
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:32,256
I'm gonna call it, saveButton.

68
00:04:32,256 --> 00:04:36,179
And Continue.

69
00:04:36,179 --> 00:04:39,700
And let's rename the Goodbye Button.

70
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,870
Let's call that Refresh Button.

71
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:52,530
So it really saves a lot of time using
these refactor kinda shortcuts in Eclipse.

72
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:54,225
Because they will find all the places
where

73
00:04:54,225 --> 00:04:55,935
you will, you can get's changed for you.

74
00:04:55,935 --> 00:05:02,240
So that's the toolbar, toolbar delegate,
if I run, if i run this application now.

75
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,000
Actually I can't because I've got an error
in my mainframe.

76
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,755
Because this now leads to declare.

77
00:05:07,755 --> 00:05:10,518
And what we got is message method, message

78
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:13,990
about serial version ID which we don't
really need.

79
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:17,266
But I'll get it one of those to shut It
up.

80
00:05:17,266 --> 00:05:22,136
And then we should have another error in
there,

81
00:05:22,136 --> 00:05:27,117
because down here, and the toolbar is now
has the same

82
00:05:27,117 --> 00:05:33,410
event, that doesn't that doesn't accept
any text.

83
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:35,970
And let's go ahead and get rid of this,
reference to the text panel.

84
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:43,265
And the the Toolbar Listener has to have a
method called

85
00:05:43,265 --> 00:05:50,070
public void and Refresh Occurred, so let's
add that there.

86
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:51,340
So we're getting there.

87
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:58,010
And also I've got this toolbar that the
message is set in the listening toolbar.

88
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:02,325
A moment it's called setStringListener,
which can as well be appropriately sets

89
00:06:02,325 --> 00:06:07,280
right-click on that, go to Refactor >
Rename, I'll call it setTool.

90
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,160
ToolbarListener.

91
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:16,410
Okay, so that's just is a lot of stuff,
but just dealing with the tool bar.

92
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:21,780
And now, if someone clicks that's actually

93
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,950
how this works, so we've always got
practice.

94
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:28,420
So if they click Save button, I wanna emit
saved in console down there.

95
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:32,860
And if I click Refresh, let's have it say
Refresh.

96
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,830
So, Save and Refresh.

97
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,023
That looks good.

98
00:06:37,023 --> 00:06:41,432
Okay, and so if someone clicked Save.

99
00:06:41,432 --> 00:06:46,333
And by the way sometimes when this
application's quit, especially if you

100
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:51,780
click cross bar, sometimes there's that
InterruptedException down here,

101
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:55,123
and that's actually a little book in swing
as far as

102
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:59,320
I know, and there is some stuff on google
about it.

103
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,570
And I found what seems to be a fix for it

104
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:04,400
and I'm gonna show you later, but it
doesn't really affect anything.

105
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:12,150
And strangely, if you quit by using the
menu item here, you don't seem to get it.

106
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:16,040
So it's quite odd but we will be fixing
that later on, not that it matters.

107
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:20,910
And so here if say, it was clicked.

108
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:27,660
I wanna basically invoke the save method
in the database here, but before that

109
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:33,150
we gotta connect to the database, and the
way I wrote the database code

110
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:36,060
you'll recall is that you can click

111
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,930
connect multiple times, and if it's
already

112
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:41,309
connected, and in fact if it is not null,
it just won't do anything.

113
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,810
And now the first thing I wanna do is cuz
I've

114
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:51,720
decided not to have my GUI call my model
code directly.

115
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,020
It's gonna go through Controller.

116
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:55,850
I need some wrapper methods in my
Controller.

117
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:05,250
And, in my Controller, I need to have a
save method from my database.

118
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,630
So public void save.

119
00:08:08,368 --> 00:08:11,627
And let's just say db.save.

120
00:08:11,627 --> 00:08:15,420
And that's gonna have to throw an
exception.

121
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:22,360
And then we'll have public void close,
which close the database.

122
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:27,070
Closes the database connection, db.close.

123
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:31,170
I'm gonna look at where to put that in the
next tutorial so

124
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,660
actually I maybe call it disconnect.

125
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,100
Let's see, disconnect, yeah.

126
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:43,550
And yeah, disconnect actually doesn't
throw an exception, so that's fine.

127
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:49,190
now, I yeah, I've got, I've already got my
save method there.

128
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:50,590
So that's good.

129
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:54,400
So now in the toolbar here in the yeah, in

130
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,930
the mainframe we're actually works when it
listens to the toolbar.

131
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:02,160
When the event is occurs, which
corresponds to

132
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,640
the save button being clicked in the
toolbar.

133
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:10,062
Then I wanna say controller.connect.

134
00:09:10,062 --> 00:09:15,630
So, controller.connect.

135
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:16,130
Where are we?

136
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:22,485
Controler, oh not connect, but yeah, I

137
00:09:22,485 --> 00:09:27,260
didn't like the connect method yeah,
actually.

138
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:31,020
I want the public void connect in fact

139
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,910
let's call this closed, let's call it
disconnect.

140
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,830
That's maybe, makes more sense.

141
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:38,435
And that's gonna fire, that's gonna call
db.connect.

142
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:41,500
And that throws an exception.

143
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:45,190
So I've got connect and the disconnect
method, I've got my save

144
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:48,810
method, and actually I also need to put
public void load method.

145
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:51,660
All of these are purely rapid methods in
the controller.

146
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:54,880
And, and you might decide that, to just
kind of,

147
00:09:54,880 --> 00:10:01,060
call the database code directly from the
review if you code.

148
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:03,650
But it's really up to you.

149
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:05,550
okay, so

150
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,200
that looks good.

151
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,800
And now in the main frame, let's

152
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,890
say controller.connect if you click that
button.

153
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:18,250
And then I'm gonna say, controller.save.

154
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:25,400
So controller, controller.save.

155
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:30,043
Now the connect button shows an exception,
so

156
00:10:30,043 --> 00:10:35,052
I'm gonna handle that surrounded try and
catch.

157
00:10:35,052 --> 00:10:40,752
And if, we can't connect to the database,
I'm gonna say J

158
00:10:40,752 --> 00:10:47,520
options paid dot and it's just
JoptionPaid.yes dot.

159
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,290
And, and let's how I show

160
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:54,160
show com, show confirm dialog.

161
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,800
Actually just show info dialog would do
the trick.

162
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:04,600
And showMessageDialog, there we go, that's
what mean, showMessageDialog.

163
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:13,750
And I wanna use the constructor here, that
this constructor and let's select that.

164
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:17,090
And maximize the editor.

165
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:20,840
And in here, so for this I need to pass
the MainFrame.this.

166
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:24,570
I can't just use this by itself because,

167
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:26,779
this enormous class here has it's own
bliz.

168
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:36,850
And the message there is gonna be cannot
connect to database.

169
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:46,870
And the title is gonna be Database, I
don't know, Database Connection Problem.

170
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:57,390
And let's have JOptionPane.warning
error_message.

171
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:57,890
That's the one.

172
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:02,210
So that should look good, I think.

173
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:10,280
And then, if everything goes well, we'll
do control adopt saver.

174
00:12:12,086 --> 00:12:15,480
And that also throws the sequel exception.

175
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:24,060
So I'm not really sure why it's not giving
me the option to to handle it here.

176
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:27,183
Although yet, the mainframe is showing an
error.

177
00:12:27,183 --> 00:12:29,330
Well let's, let's deal with that.

178
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:34,360
So and it's such in its throne from

179
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:39,652
the controller there, is it's actually SQL
exception.

180
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:46,160
So I feel like Eclipse is being a little
bit, temperamental here.

181
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:52,120
But, it's probably something that, wrong
or something, I'm not sure.

182
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:55,847
So that throws a sequence conception.

183
00:12:55,847 --> 00:13:02,140
And controller.connect can actually throws
an exception.

184
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,300
Okay.

185
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,590
I can't remember why, but that's good.

186
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:12,000
Okay, and now, here now It's letting me
add controller.save.

187
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,910
So let's add a try-catch around that.

188
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:17,200
That throws the SQL exception.

189
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,705
And we'll have a message box that pops up

190
00:13:19,705 --> 00:13:23,870
there saying something very similar to the
first message box.

191
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:29,410
And, let's say, Unable to save to
database.

192
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:31,860
We don't know why.

193
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:35,230
But we'll pop up a suitable message if
that happens.

194
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:42,400
So now we want the, in, in this refresh
method

195
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,770
that's triggered, if you click a Refresh
button on the toolbar.

196
00:13:46,168 --> 00:13:51,370
I want to say controller dot dot load.

197
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:57,390
And that throws an exception, so let's
handle that.

198
00:13:57,390 --> 00:14:02,044
I'm gonna use this kind of message box.

199
00:14:02,044 --> 00:14:10,599
And it's gonna say Unable to load from
database.

200
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:15,155
And we're also gonna have a similar thing
here.

201
00:14:15,155 --> 00:14:18,013
I'm gonna have this, like if you can't
connect

202
00:14:18,013 --> 00:14:20,811
to the database, I need to pop up this
message.

203
00:14:20,811 --> 00:14:26,662
But rather than repeat the code, let's
maybe just have a message called

204
00:14:26,662 --> 00:14:32,778
connect the, sorry method called connect,
you can call it a message.

205
00:14:32,778 --> 00:14:36,507
Method call, connects the call to connect
method.

206
00:14:36,507 --> 00:14:38,543
And let's just implement that method here.

207
00:14:38,543 --> 00:14:42,871
Private void connect, and in connect I'm
just gonna put the code for

208
00:14:42,871 --> 00:14:49,100
connecting to the database and popping up
the error message if that doesn't work.

209
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,695
Now, I think that should do the trick.

210
00:14:50,695 --> 00:14:52,740
So, I'm gonna run this.

211
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:57,720
And in my database I've got a couple of
files in there John, Sue.

212
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,580
So let's click Refresh and see what
happens.

213
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:06,880
Oh yeah, there's something that I actually
forgot, which is that when the refresh

214
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:12,460
event occurs, I've got to call
tablePanel.refresh

215
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:15,090
otherwise it's not going to display
anything.

216
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:18,920
So let's run that and click Refresh, and
there we go.

217
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,490
Look our values.

218
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:26,635
And if I put another one in here, I'll
call myself John, cuz that's

219
00:15:26,635 --> 00:15:32,708
my name software 1865 and self employed,
thank you very much.

220
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:35,250
[INAUDIBLE] Click OK.

221
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,279
And then just click Save.

222
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:38,090
And,

223
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:49,096
now, we can see in the database hopefully,
if I do a refresh, there I am, John.

224
00:15:49,096 --> 00:15:51,466
Of course there's, there's lots of ways
you

225
00:15:51,466 --> 00:15:53,956
could refine this, but I'm not gonna worry

226
00:15:53,956 --> 00:15:56,204
too much about it in this tutorial,
because

227
00:15:56,204 --> 00:16:00,500
the tutorial is just gonna get
ridiculously long unnecessarily.

228
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,780
But you could, you know you could have a

229
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:05,590
message saying no data saved or something
popping up

230
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:11,840
at the bottom or who knows or even a pop
up box, well that could be quite annoying.

231
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:19,210
Or you could, I don't know you could make
the button go grey to click save and then

232
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:25,330
you could make it unable to get someone
added to the table or something like that.

233
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:27,860
But I'll leave that for the moment.

234
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:28,720
So, that's that.

235
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,040
I hope that was useful, just wiring

236
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,370
in existing stuff, just wiring is all
together.

237
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:36,550
And, in the next tutorial, we're gonna
look

238
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:38,970
at something that I've left out of this
tutorial.

239
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:41,320
Which is like, okay, we've connected to
the

240
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:45,450
database, but where do you disconnect from
the database.

241
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:50,412
And to disconnect from the database, we're
gonna intercept the window closing event,

242
00:16:50,412 --> 00:16:52,662
and even though we're gonna disconnect

243
00:16:52,662 --> 00:16:55,190
from the database before the window
closes.

244
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:59,190
And I'm also gonna fix, fix this bug that
I mentioned earlier.

245
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:04,540
Which is, is sometimes you see like a
thread interrupted exception.

246
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:08,141
When you, when you quit the the, the swing

247
00:17:08,141 --> 00:17:13,292
program by clicking on this thing here,
without [INAUDIBLE] swing.

248
00:17:13,292 --> 00:17:16,046
And I don't think there's actually wrong
with this code.

249
00:17:16,046 --> 00:17:21,526
Okay, so join me again next time and until
then, happy coding

250
00:17:21,526 --> 00:17:24,899
