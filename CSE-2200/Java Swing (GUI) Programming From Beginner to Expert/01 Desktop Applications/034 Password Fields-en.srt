00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:04,700
Hello, this is John from
caveofprogramming.com.

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:10,860
And this is a tutorial on password fields
in Java Swing.

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:17,066
So I'm gonna add a password field and a
username to my dialog here.

4
00:00:17,066 --> 00:00:19,914
Because this is gonna be the connection
details

5
00:00:19,914 --> 00:00:22,770
for a database connection to a MySQL
database.

6
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:28,920
So, I'm gonna here's the preference dialog
class I created in a previous tutorial.

7
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,830
And, password fields work pretty much like
j, text

8
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:38,370
fields except that they don't show what
you're typing.

9
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:43,440
So here let's create a, I'm going
jTextField for the user name.

10
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,230
I'll call it userField.

11
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:54,620
And I'm going to create a jPasswordField,
passField for the password.

12
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,530
And set the input.

13
00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:06,690
And down here I can say userField equals
new jTextField.

14
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:10,420
And let's give that a length of ten.

15
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:16,280
And I say passField equals new
jPasswordField.

16
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:20,638
And I'll give that a length of ten as
well.

17
00:01:20,638 --> 00:01:24,614
And now, let's add these to the grid back
layout.

18
00:01:24,614 --> 00:01:28,116
So I'll start with gridy equal to 0 here,

19
00:01:28,116 --> 00:01:31,456
and I'm gonna add them right at the top
here.

20
00:01:31,456 --> 00:01:38,020
So the stuff that I want to add looks
pretty much like this.

21
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:40,140
So let's have a comment here.

22
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:42,750
So this is gonna be first row.

23
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:49,260
And then after that I'll just say, next
row, next row.

24
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:55,173
So I'm gonna paste some stuff in here, and
for the

25
00:01:55,173 --> 00:02:00,439
next row, I'm gonna need to increment
gc.grid y, plus plus.

26
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:04,249
And this is all stuff that we did, in in
designing

27
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:09,580
the the form panel that goes on the left
in this application.

28
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:14,115
And I'm gonna change this to user, and
I'll change this to

29
00:02:14,115 --> 00:02:18,850
userField, and, let's take a look and see
if that looks okay.

30
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,800
And it does, apart from being, a mess at
the moment.

31
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,120
And I'm gonna add the same thing again.

32
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,510
So let's delete some of this.

33
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:33,715
And, I'll copy this and under the

34
00:02:33,715 --> 00:02:36,890
userField I'm going to add in the
password.

35
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:43,480
So, I'll say passField and make this say
password.

36
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:50,610
And, I'll try looking [INAUDIBLE] and that
looks like a user password port.

37
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:54,460
So it's a bit of a mess at the moment, but
we're gonna fix that, in the future.

38
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:58,390
And we're just gonna spend one tutorial on
making this look a bit nicer.

39
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:01,020
But, for the moment, so, userField, of
course it's just

40
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:03,710
a text field so I can type my name in
there.

41
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:08,740
And, in here, when you type stuff it
doesn't actually show what you're typing.

42
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:11,859
And you can, you can actually configure
what character

43
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:14,391
it shows if you want to, when you type
stuff.

44
00:03:14,391 --> 00:03:22,840
By saying, take a password field and call
these setEchoChar method.

45
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:27,640
And pass in, pass in a character there to
that and is

46
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,270
the one that will be displayed instead of
the text that you're typing.

47
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:31,040
So let's have a look at that.

48
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,800
And if I run that.

49
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,607
So we can see now we've got asterisks
instead of sorta circles.

50
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:43,664
When you want a text from a pass, password
field.

51
00:03:43,664 --> 00:03:47,068
So down here the action is from my OK
button, and I'm,

52
00:03:47,068 --> 00:03:51,290
I'm getting the value from the port
spinner control at the moment.

53
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,820
And of course to get the text from

54
00:03:54,820 --> 00:04:01,430
the user field, I'd say equals
userField.get text.

55
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:06,088
To get the password from the password
field, I need to say

56
00:04:06,088 --> 00:04:15,940
passField.getPass, at least I thought it
was getPass.

57
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,210
Let's take a look.

58
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,580
password.

59
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:23,148
Let's take a look at the API document
here.

60
00:04:23,148 --> 00:04:25,810
It's [INAUDIBLE].

61
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:29,323
Yeah, get password so I don't know what
the problem was there.

62
00:04:29,323 --> 00:04:33,884
Autocomplete running out on me, there we
go.

63
00:04:33,884 --> 00:04:37,958
And that actually returns and array of
chars.

64
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:45,109
So if I unfortunately I have this little
problem if the

65
00:04:45,109 --> 00:04:52,806
right square bracket is set to a some
sorta shortcut in Eclipse.

66
00:04:52,806 --> 00:05:00,365
So I can't type that very easily, but
let's try typing one left square bracket.

67
00:05:00,365 --> 00:05:04,705
And with a bit of luck Eclipse will to
complete, so except

68
00:05:04,705 --> 00:05:08,548
this, so this is an array of chars instead
of a string.

69
00:05:08,548 --> 00:05:15,380
And I'm gonna set that equal to the
password field and get password.

70
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,860
So there we go, we got there in the end,
and if

71
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:23,040
I output that just to show you, in fact,
let's output the user.

72
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:29,634
And then, the password and so there we go.

73
00:05:29,634 --> 00:05:33,620
Actually I'm not sure if I can yeah, well
let's try this and see how it looks.

74
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:36,490
If I run this and then go to Window >

75
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:41,630
Preferences and type user John and
password and click OK.

76
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:47,103
You get and this is a representation
unfortunately of the array of characters

77
00:05:47,103 --> 00:05:52,677
and you've got like an array bracket there
to show that, that it's an array.

78
00:05:52,677 --> 00:05:54,189
And this tells you it's an array of

79
00:05:54,189 --> 00:05:57,070
characters I believe and that's the hash
code.

80
00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:04,570
So that's no use, but what I can do is, I
can wrap this into, a string let's say.

81
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:08,517
So, new stringPassword.

82
00:06:08,517 --> 00:06:14,070
And then, if I run that, let's

83
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:20,300
go, and then, I'll type some stuff in here
and click OK.

84
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,390
Now, I've got the password out of this
text.

85
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:28,360
So just by wrapping the array of chars in
a string, you can then output it.

86
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:31,710
So that's it for this tutorial.

87
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:37,212
And in the next tutorial, we're going to
look at making this dialog,

88
00:06:37,212 --> 00:06:42,850
this dialog that we've been working on,
save a default value so that.

89
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:46,870
When you type stuff and quit the
application and then start

90
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:50,330
it again, it will remember the values that
you entered last time.

91
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:55,460
Cuz you want it to store these connection
values between, between runs.

92
00:06:55,460 --> 00:07:00,100
And to do that we're gonna use,
properties, which are great for

93
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:03,800
storing all kinds of things about your
application that you want to persist.

94
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,990
Such as you know the window size and the
location, and that kinda thing.

95
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:12,670
OK, so that's for next time, and until
then, happy coding.

96
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:14,703
