00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:05,270
Hello this is John from
caveofprograming.com.

2
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:10,780
And in this tutorial we're gonna look at
model dialogues because

3
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:15,380
so the moment if I run this application
and I tick and load in this tree

4
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:21,840
it retrieves messages and that something
separate thread.

5
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,180
So my dialogue is response, is responsive
while that happens.

6
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:26,700
And usually, actually, if you're doing
something in

7
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:30,140
the background you want your application
to be responsive.

8
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,660
But sometimes you want to remote a

9
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:35,470
dialogue like if you absolutely need to
use

10
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:39,130
to answer input before anything else
happens

11
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:41,730
or if you're doing some really heavy
processing.

12
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:45,570
And the application would basically be
unresponsive, anyway,

13
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:49,730
until the operation completes, or user
clicks cancel.

14
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:51,180
Then you'd want modal dialog.

15
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:54,220
And here I'm just gonna pop one up just to
demonstrate them to you.

16
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:58,020
And we're gonna ultimately put a progress
bar in that modal dialog.

17
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:04,840
So I'm gonna create a new class here in my
GUI package.

18
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:08,220
And I say New > Class.

19
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,505
And we'll call that ProgressDialog.

20
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:21,120
And let's, let's make that derive inherit
from JDialog and click Finish.

21
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,310
And add the import Ctrl+Shift+O.

22
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:27,877
And here I'll give this a constructor,
public ProgressDialog.

23
00:01:27,877 --> 00:01:32,380
Now JDialog has various possible
constructors you can use.

24
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:39,840
And I wanna use the one, that let's me
specify the modality, of, dialog.

25
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,740
And I'm also, I'll have a title there as
well.

26
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,580
So let's have the first argument, here, is
gonna be

27
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:51,320
the parent, so I'm gonna parse in to the
constructor actually.

28
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,430
But, I'll leave that for moment.

29
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:58,500
And then I'm gonna have a title here, that
says, Message is Downloading.

30
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:04,970
And finally, let's have the modality,
ModalityType dot.

31
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:10,550
And I'm gonna make a application modal,
and you can also have document

32
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:16,870
modal, that would make a modal just for
your particular window.

33
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:21,070
But I'm just gonna demonstrate application
modal here, just simpler.

34
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:25,140
So the parent, is gonna be something that
I'm gonna parse in.

35
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:28,760
So window parent, like that.

36
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:34,830
And for the moment, let's just set the
size here.

37
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,635
SetSize.

38
00:02:36,635 --> 00:02:40,050
SetSize just to something that's gonna be
visible.

39
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:46,440
Well, let's make it, I don't know, 400
wide, 200 high just for the moment.

40
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:53,100
And, now I'm just gonna hired to show that
dialog from my message panel.

41
00:02:54,845 --> 00:02:56,490
Let's click Refresh here.

42
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:58,273
Refresh.

43
00:02:58,273 --> 00:03:03,563
And so in my message panel I start a at
one

44
00:03:03,563 --> 00:03:08,857
point I retrieve messages, so if you click
something

45
00:03:08,857 --> 00:03:13,818
in a tree and it opens to retrieve
messages thing.

46
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:17,240
And here I want to popup a dialog.

47
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:28,190
Now let's add, the, the dialog here as
page private instance variable.

48
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:33,210
Let's type private ProgressDialog.

49
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:35,414
And I'll call that progressDialog.

50
00:03:35,414 --> 00:03:41,522
And in the constructor I'll create a new
progress dialog,

51
00:03:41,522 --> 00:03:47,520
so I'll say progressDialog equals new
ProgressDialog.

52
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,530
This is all pretty straightforward.

53
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:58,922
And, and now is the, is a twist because I
wanna say here progressDialog.show.

54
00:03:58,922 --> 00:04:01,711
ProgressDialog.setVisible actually.

55
00:04:01,711 --> 00:04:08,568
ProgressDialog.setVisible true.

56
00:04:08,568 --> 00:04:14,800
And but now that, the problem with that,
is that if you set a modal dialog visible,

57
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,810
then nothing will happen in your
application, in

58
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:22,380
your thread until you've, until it's gone
away again.

59
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:28,650
So, I wanna run it in one of these
separate kinda swing threads.

60
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:33,700
I wanna, I wanna use SwingUtilities.info
later to run it.

61
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,020
Which will just run it, it will just run
it in

62
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,740
such a way that it's not gonna hold up my
application.

63
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,820
And I say new runnable in there.

64
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,600
And, and let's whoops.

65
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:55,226
Let's add the semicolon there at the run
method here public void run.

66
00:04:55,226 --> 00:04:58,977
And, if I put it in there, it's not,

67
00:04:58,977 --> 00:05:04,620
it's not gonna hold up my application when
it runs.

68
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:07,090
It's just gonna be scheduled to run.

69
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:10,510
At some, at, at this possible moment.

70
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:15,738
So, now, in, in my done method

71
00:05:15,738 --> 00:05:21,162
in the SwingWorker thread, I can

72
00:05:21,162 --> 00:05:26,804
set the dialog to, to invisible.

73
00:05:26,804 --> 00:05:30,623
So here's my done method.

74
00:05:30,623 --> 00:05:35,563
And, in here, let's just, let's just say

75
00:05:35,563 --> 00:05:41,160
here progressDialog.setVisible, false.

76
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:47,496
Now, just to show you what I mean about
this a visible holding things up in the

77
00:05:47,496 --> 00:05:54,137
modal dialog, let's put this out here and
let's say, showing modal dialog.

78
00:05:54,137 --> 00:05:59,869
And let's put the sys out after this,
after the show,

79
00:05:59,869 --> 00:06:04,860
sys out and say finished showing modal
dialog.

80
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:10,430
And now let's run that and see how it
looks.

81
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:13,470
It's got an error in there somewhere.

82
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:14,000
Where's my error?

83
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,440
Let's take a look.

84
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,830
So somewhere in here, oh, I just I think I
just didn't save it.

85
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:21,360
No, I did save it.

86
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,390
Oh, yeah, I didn't parse it in.

87
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,320
The reference the parent.

88
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:31,120
Now if I parse in this, because I need
here, I need the parent dialog.

89
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,290
This is a panel, so that's not gonna cut
the mustard for a window.

90
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:35,700
But if I say this dot, well, if

91
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:42,950
I say getParent and then getParent returns
container.

92
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:45,350
Well, I can actually cast that into a
window.

93
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:50,090
Cuz the parent of this panel is a window,
so I think that will work.

94
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:51,830
And now if I save that and I run it.

95
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:55,290
Let's see how this looks.

96
00:06:55,290 --> 00:07:04,060
So if I tick this here my dialog appeared
before Eclipse.

97
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,800
Let's see that again.

98
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:14,610
So I'll quit the application and let's
show the console down here.

99
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:20,220
Let's run the application and tick
something in the tree.

100
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,890
There's my dialog, and I can't do anything
in

101
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:26,170
the rest of the application, until it's
finished there.

102
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:28,360
Let's try it one more time.

103
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,310
So it's modal, it won't go away.

104
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,910
And you can see that it's processing
messages there in the background.

105
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:40,510
And when it finishes then you press that
until

106
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:44,060
it finishes, and I'm stuck which is what I
want.

107
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:50,232
Okay, so now in the next tutorial we'll
gonna

108
00:07:50,232 --> 00:07:55,428
look at showing a progress bar in this
modal dialog.

109
00:07:55,428 --> 00:07:59,356
And, until next time, happy coding.

110
00:07:59,356 --> 00:08:06,269
