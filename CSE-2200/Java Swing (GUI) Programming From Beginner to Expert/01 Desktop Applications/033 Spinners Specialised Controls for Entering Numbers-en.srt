00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:05,770
Hello, this is John from
caveofprogramming.com.

2
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:12,190
Welcome back again, and in this tutorial,
we're gonna look at Spinner Controls.

3
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:14,640
And Spinner Controls are little
specialized

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:19,431
controls for entering numbers in Java.

5
00:00:19,431 --> 00:00:23,790
So I've got my application set up at the
moment to produce

6
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:29,000
this blank dialogue, and I'm gonna add
some controls to this dialogue.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,540
And in this particular tutorial, I'm just
gonna write

8
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:36,580
the minimum controls that we need to
demonstrate with JSpinner.

9
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:45,313
So, here in my dialog class, I'm gonna
start by creating a, I'm gonna add a

10
00:00:45,313 --> 00:00:52,860
JButton okbutton = new JButton.

11
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:58,060
actually, let's I've, I'll actually create
a new the new

12
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:01,580
objects and shape of an object down here
in constructor.

13
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:04,410
Although I could equally create it here
when

14
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:07,610
I declare a variable that would still be
okay.

15
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:16,650
And, and let's have a private J button,
cancel button.

16
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:23,210
And I'm going to add a J spinner here.

17
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:25,150
So, J spinner, and I'm going to call it
port

18
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:31,600
spinner, because this dialog is actually
gonna store database connection details.

19
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,960
And in a future tutorial we will look, we
will have kind of a whistle-stop

20
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,580
tour of JDBC and we'll look at connecting
this application to a database.

21
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,190
And there's another thing that I need
here.

22
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:55,325
I also need a private spinnerNumberModel

23
00:01:55,325 --> 00:02:01,740
and this is the data model behind the
spinner.

24
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,250
And that will allow me to set minimum

25
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,400
maximum values to my spinner and also the
increment.

26
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,190
When you click the little up down button
at the side of the spinner.

27
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:16,230
So let's go ahead and create these
controls but actually

28
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:18,120
there's one thing that I want to quickly
fix before I

29
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,240
do that because at the moment, even though
I specify the

30
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:25,150
parent from my dialog, for reasons that I
don't fully understand.

31
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:28,300
It still, still appears in the corner of
the window there.

32
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:33,920
So I'm just gonna quickly here, say, set
location relative to.

33
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,490
And I'm just gonna pass in, the parent the
J frame parent.

34
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,050
Because, otherwise that's gonna drive me
crazy.

35
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:46,190
So now if I do window preferences it comes
up in a nice location.

36
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,430
Okay, that's much better.

37
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:53,395
now, yeah, I don't know what that was
about.

38
00:02:53,395 --> 00:02:59,450
Okay, so, let's now create these controls.

39
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:05,520
So I'll say okButton = new JButton("OK").

40
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:15,110
And we'll have cancelButton = new
JButton("Cancel").

41
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:18,560
So you should always have okay and cancel
buttons on your dialogue or

42
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,280
at least you stores allow the user

43
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,140
to cancel the dialogue without changing
anything.

44
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,600
And I'll say spinnerModel,

45
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:35,280
equals new J, equals new Spinning of the
model.

46
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,550
Actually that doesn't really have to be a,
private instanced

47
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:42,830
variable, because that isn't gonna need it
again, but that's okay.

48
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:48,300
And now, to the constructor's spinning
number model, firstly, just to control

49
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:52,900
space there, I'm going to use this
constructor, he's gonna store integers.

50
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,050
And firstly I'll pass it the value that I

51
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:58,300
want to set when it, when the spinner
appears.

52
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,280
And as far as I can remember, the MySQL
server runs

53
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,070
by default on port 3306, or set up for the
default.

54
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:10,068
And let's set the minimum at 0, and the
maximum at

55
00:04:10,068 --> 00:04:15,420
12349, so 9999 and the step size is gonna
be one.

56
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:21,240
And then when I create my j spinner I can
say quote spinner

57
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:27,710
equals new j spinner and I can pass in the
spinner model in constructor

58
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:35,540
and now I can set the layout and add these

59
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:41,220
controls so I can say set layout set
layouts.

60
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:48,010
If I can get the right keys set layout,
new grid bag.

61
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:53,271
It's our old friend here grid bag layout.

62
00:04:53,271 --> 00:05:00,325
And I'm gonna also create a
GridBagConstraints.

63
00:05:00,325 --> 00:05:01,265
So GridBagConstraints

64
00:05:03,675 --> 00:05:07,215
gc equals new GridBagConstraints.

65
00:05:07,215 --> 00:05:12,705
And I'm gonna add controls here in rows.

66
00:05:12,705 --> 00:05:19,250
So, the first row will be GC.gridy

67
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:24,560
equals zero and then set GC.gridx equals

68
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,590
zero and then I'll also set up some
defaults here.

69
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:38,000
I'll say GC.weightx for the moment, I'll
set equal to one, GC.weighty equals one.

70
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,900
And if you don't set this stuff at the

71
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,940
start then you can run into some problems
later on.

72
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:47,750
And gc.fill, I can set it equal to
horizontal, vertical, both,

73
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,680
or none, and I'm going to set it equal to
grid

74
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:56,790
back constraints.none, because I want my
controls

75
00:05:56,790 --> 00:06:02,160
to be their preferred size, rather than to
be, rather than to fill the whole cell.

76
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:09,150
so, now, let's go ahead and say let's add.

77
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:14,610
I'll add a new j label for start and I'll
set, I'll set that equal to, I'll set the

78
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:20,800
text on it to port colon, space, comma

79
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:26,455
GC and then, next to that on the right, I
will say

80
00:06:26,455 --> 00:06:34,231
pc.gridx equals let's just do plus plus
actually.

81
00:06:34,231 --> 00:06:41,600
And then I'll say add, and I'll add my
spinner here, support spinner comma gc.

82
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,220
So that's one rows, sort it out.

83
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:47,330
And then let's go to the next row.

84
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:50,380
So let's have a, comment here.

85
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:56,633
Next row, and I'll do gc.grid y plus

86
00:06:56,633 --> 00:07:03,250
plus and go back to gc.grid x, equals
zero.

87
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,990
Here I'm gonna up my, cancel button.

88
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:13,550
If you bring up the dialogue for example,
let's see, custom inspected, you

89
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:17,970
can see the cancel button's usually on
the, right so it stays here.

90
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,700
So let's add the okay button here.

91
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:25,930
So I'll say add okay button comma gc and

92
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:30,566
then gc.gridx plus plus and add

93
00:07:30,566 --> 00:07:35,650
cancel button comma gc.

94
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:41,540
Now with a bit of luck, or lots of luck
this will appear reasonably presentable.

95
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,460
So there we are.

96
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:46,100
We need to address the spacing issues
here.

97
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,910
But we've got a spinner.

98
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:52,680
And you can see, it's even got a comma in
it, so it's nicely formatted there.

99
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,960
And I can increase or decrease the spinner
like this.

100
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,850
And it's got a minimum and maximum value.

101
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:02,170
I can type in one there, but it won't go
below

102
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:06,750
zero no matter what I do and the maximum
is 9999.

103
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,940
So let's try, let's try that.

104
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:14,040
I can't increase beyond that and so there
we go.

105
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:22,300
and, if I try typing in, I can type in
greater values, but

106
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:28,010
and if I do that, I just, it won't let me
change it anymore.

107
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:28,630
It's gone funny.

108
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:36,250
So, anyway, let's now get the value from
that

109
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:42,645
spinner [UNKNOWN] so, I wanna add an
action list now, to the OK button.

110
00:08:42,645 --> 00:08:47,420
OK button to add action list, I mean
there's a, you know

111
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:52,320
the routine now, by now with this so add
action, action

112
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,978
listener, and so I'll say, you know, say
new action listener

113
00:08:57,978 --> 00:09:03,610
and then open the [UNKNOWN] brackets here
at the unimplemented methods.

114
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:10,300
You can port action this in the first, add
an implementing method, and let's maximize

115
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:16,550
the editor, get rid of some space that I
don't want, add the

116
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:20,750
semicolon in here, and now at this point,
I can get the value from

117
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,000
the spinner control, and it's just a

118
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,450
little complication here because the
spinner actually returns.

119
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:34,911
If I say, if I say at this point, spinner

120
00:09:34,911 --> 00:09:39,780
what do I call that actually, I called it
port spinner.

121
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:46,260
So port spinner.get, there's a get value
if you look

122
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:49,510
at it actually returns a object, but now I
know

123
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:53,180
that I'm storing integers in this spinner,
so I can

124
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:57,830
cuss this to a integer, cuz it's gotta be
a integer.

125
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:02,396
And I can say integer value

126
00:10:02,396 --> 00:10:09,010
equals, and then cuss the return type of
ports.getValue to that value.

127
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:10,810
And finish off this tutorial, I'm just

128
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:15,360
gonna output the value here in the
console.

129
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,860
So if I run this and get to preferences
dialogue, and

130
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:28,490
maybe change that a little bit, and click
okay, I'm gonna get the value 3301.

131
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:29,810
Yeah.

132
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:34,250
And actually, one, thing that I could also
do is,

133
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:40,860
I can also make the dialogue go away when
you click "OK" or "Cancel" so I can

134
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:47,130
say set, setVisible here, false.

135
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:50,910
And I can also add a, if I just copy

136
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:55,680
that and add a listener to the cancel
button, the only

137
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,330
difference between the cancel button and
the OK button is

138
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:02,930
that the OK button, gets values and does
stuff with them.

139
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:07,770
Before setting visible defaults, and,
apart from that, the seminar.

140
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:11,190
So now hopefully, if I go into preferences
here

141
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:14,617
[NOISE] console will just get rid of my
dialogue.

142
00:11:14,617 --> 00:11:17,730
And okay will get rid of my dialogue.

143
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:22,067
But first it will retrieve the value from
that spinner.

144
00:11:22,067 --> 00:11:26,630
So, let's just see that one more time.

145
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:31,550
So set 3311, click okay, and we get 3311
down there in the console.

146
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,020
Okay, so that's it for this tutorial.

147
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:37,120
In the next tutorial we're gonna look at
password controls because

148
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:42,030
we're gonna store a user name and password
in this dialogue.

149
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,780
And we're gonna create one of those
password

150
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:48,610
controls that, where you just see, like
asterisks

151
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:52,240
in stead of she's seeing what you're
typing,

152
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,685
to hide what you're typing from other
people.

153
00:11:54,685 --> 00:11:59,470
Okay, so join me again then, and until
then, happy coding.
