00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:05,980
Hello, this is John from
caveofprogramming.com again.

2
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:09,680
And in this tutorial we're gonna look at
how

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:14,550
to take this text area in our basic Swing
application

4
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:18,450
and turn it into a simple custom
component, and we're

5
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,540
also gonna add some scroll bars to this
text area.

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,660
So, at the moment the way this works is if
I look at main

7
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:31,620
out, I've just got a text area, which I'm
adding directly into the, main frame.

8
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,730
And, what I want to do is to begin to

9
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:43,150
break this application down, simple,
though, it is into separate components.

10
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:49,410
So, that we can work and each component
can kind of take care of itself, and that

11
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:55,520
the application as a whole, is basically
simplified as we add more stuff to it.

12
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,200
So what I'll do is I'll create a new class
here.

13
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:06,500
So new class and I'm gonna use something
called a jPanel

14
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:11,600
and I'm gonna call my custom component my,
my custom

15
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:17,900
class here, I'm gonna call it text panel
because it's a kind of panel.

16
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:23,760
And I'm gonna say that the Superclass of
text panel here is gonna be a jPanel.

17
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,540
So, I'll click Finish.

18
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:35,669
And, at the input there, and panels are,
basically, just kind of

19
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:43,340
depending on your operating system colors,
usually just sort of like gray flat areas.

20
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,040
Which you can add to your main frame.

21
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,950
But the great thing about them is that you
can add other components into them.

22
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,840
And that's what I'm gonna do here.

23
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,050
So to start with, I will just go back
here.

24
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:01,442
And, so currently I'm adding a text area
and instead of this text

25
00:02:01,442 --> 00:02:05,310
area, I'm gonna get rid of it for the
moment and say private

26
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:10,040
text panel which is the class I just
created.

27
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,390
I'll call that text panel

28
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:19,660
and down here where I created the text
area previously, I'll say text

29
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:24,070
panel equals new text panel

30
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,610
and here I'll add the text panel instead
of the text area.

31
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:33,510
And for the moment, I'm just gonna comment

32
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:36,380
this out, comment out this bit where in
response

33
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:42,770
to the button click here, we pan text to
the panel, so I just comment this out.

34
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:46,780
And if I run that now, this is what our
panel looks like, doesn't

35
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:50,170
do anything, I can't add text to it or
click on it or anything.

36
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:54,520
I can click on it, but nothing happens and
so now I'm gonna add

37
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:59,730
a text area into this panel and turn it
into a kind of custom control.

38
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:06,430
And, so, the way to do that is I'll go to
this text panel class and I'll get an

39
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:13,700
constructor public text panel and in the
constructor, I'll create a text area

40
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:20,490
so in fact I'll put a private j text area
here, text area.

41
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:27,440
And in the constructor, I'll say that text
area equals a new j text area.

42
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:34,680
And let's add the import, and I'm

43
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:39,800
gonna actually, I could just, well, I
could set the layout on the text

44
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,780
panel, and I want this, I actually want
this text

45
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:47,070
area, for the moment, just to take up the
whole panel.

46
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:50,490
And I can use again border layout, so say
set

47
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:56,570
layout, new border layout, so this is
actually setting the layout.

48
00:03:56,570 --> 00:04:01,500
Not on the mainframe but on the the jPanel
here, on the

49
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,290
text panel which is just a kind of jPanel
because it extends jPanel.

50
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:11,990
So I'll say, set layer, new border layer
and then I can just do

51
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:18,592
that bad text area and border
layout.center.

52
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:20,890
So it's very simple.

53
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:24,320
And I'm just gonna be adding in the
center, and

54
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,930
since I'm adding nothing to the north,
south, east or

55
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:29,860
west, this text panel is just gonna take
up the

56
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,530
entire area of the panel, which is what I
want.

57
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,940
Except that I'm gonna do something very

58
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,990
slightly different here because I want the
text

59
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:44,130
panel to have scrollbars, if the text
kinda goes off the edge or off the bottom.

60
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:50,460
So, to achieve that I just say here new
JScrollPane

61
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:54,330
and to the constructor of this scroll pane
I'll pass the textarea.

62
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:59,470
So, what I'm doing is just wrapping the
text area

63
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:04,090
in a j-scroll pane and now if I run this,
you

64
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:07,120
can see I've got, we've got this this is
the text

65
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,530
panel and it's got this nice text area in
it now.

66
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:13,080
And if I just put more text in than
there's

67
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:17,120
room for, I get this, this scroll, scroll
bar appears.

68
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,840
And the same if I hit return a bit,

69
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,630
like a vertical scroll bar here, which is
very nice.

70
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,440
And you can use scroll bars with.

71
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,830
All kinds of different swing components.

72
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:31,240
And, just wrap them in a j scroll pane.

73
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:38,550
Now I want our text into my custom my text

74
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:42,620
panel, my custom component, when the
button is clicked as before.

75
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:49,210
So what I'll do is I'll give this a public
method called let's make it public void.

76
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:52,380
And append, appendText maybe.

77
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:57,900
And that can accept a String, called text,
and

78
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:05,930
in this method I'll just call textarea, so
the instance variable text area up here.

79
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:11,980
Textarea.append again and I'll just add
the text in there like that.

80
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,720
So now to hook this on, get it working
just as it was before, all I

81
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:22,400
have to do is back in my main frame here I
can just call text panel.

82
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:28,795
So it was textarea.append, and now it's

83
00:06:28,795 --> 00:06:35,370
textpanel.append, so I just call it append
text,

84
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:40,850
yeah, append text, and if I run that, and
click it, there you go.

85
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:44,130
Okay.

86
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:51,340
Now you see that the strategy I'm using
here, that I'm working towards is,

87
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:55,130
that the mainframe is creating lots of

88
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:58,020
different components, just two at the
moment actually.

89
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,840
And, and those components can each

90
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,799
be potentially quite sophisticated in
themselves.

91
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,920
And this is the beginning of a kind of
model for your

92
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:11,490
controller architecture, which we'll get
into a bit more as the tutorials progress.

93
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:15,610
Now in the next tutorial we're gonna look
at adding a toolbar.

94
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:17,260
So I'm gonna move that button to a
toolbar.

95
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:21,720
And we're gonna have a second custom
component instead of this button here.

96
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:26,585
So, join me again next time, and until
then, happy coding.

97
00:07:26,585 --> 00:07:30,274
