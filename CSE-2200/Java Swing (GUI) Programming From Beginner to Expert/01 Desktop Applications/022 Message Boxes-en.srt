00:00:01,597 --> 00:00:07,116
Hello, this is John from Cave of
Programming dot com and this is a tutorial

3
00:00:07,116 --> 00:00:12,278
on J Option panes which are, a quick way
of producing those handy

4
00:00:12,278 --> 00:00:17,730
little dialogues that pop up to ask you if
you wanna do things or not.

5
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:23,220
Basically, and we're just gonna show you
two simple types here, although that's

6
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:28,560
a plethora of possibilities, so in the
last tutorial,

7
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:36,440
I cre, created this application, and I, in
particular, we added some stuff to this.

8
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,260
Menu to make it work.

9
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:44,230
So if I go to exit here, it quits, or I
can also do control x, for example.

10
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:50,050
Now I want, the application to ask me if
I'm really sure that I want to quit.

11
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,950
Because although that's, quite annoying,
at the same time, it.

12
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:55,680
It can be quite useful.

13
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,760
It can stop you losing data that you
haven't saved and that sort of thing.

14
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,210
So let's assume that you think it's a good
idea to do that.

15
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:08,040
And here I'm gonna put, I'm gonna create a
little dialogue box that will

16
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,730
pop up and just ask the user if he or she
really wants to quit.

17
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:15,000
Now to do that I'm gonna use the.

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,150
J Option Pane.

19
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:20,250
So if you go to Google and search for J
Option Pane

20
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:25,100
job seven or something like that then
you'll come up with this page.

21
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:32,530
And it looks pretty ferocious but there's
only really four main possibilities.

22
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:36,600
You can create confirm dialogues, which is
what I want to create.

23
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,990
Here, a dialogue that asks you if you want
to really do something or not, and you

24
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:44,560
might have a no button on there, or a

25
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,720
cancel button, and a yes or an okay
button.

26
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:52,240
An input dialogue, which I'll show you
also in this tutorial, gets just a little

27
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:57,630
bit of input, just a little bit of text
from the user, which is sometimes useful.

28
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:01,570
Message dialogues, just display a message.

29
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:06,500
And option dialogue is the most flexible
kind of type that allows

30
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:10,150
you to kind of roll your own using a
variety of constants.

31
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:14,470
And of course check out this page to get
the, full details on this.

32
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:21,668
But here, so I want to use the static
option of J Option Pane and I'm gonna use.

33
00:02:21,668 --> 00:02:25,560
Show confirm dialogue.

34
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:31,150
So, let's just add the import and then the
auto complete will the work.

35
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:35,750
So, I'll use show confirm dialogue and you
can see that they are.

36
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:39,730
And various possibilities of constructor,
sorry not constructor.

37
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:44,150
Of overloaded method just for this show
confirm dialogue.

38
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:51,740
And the one I want to use, the simplest
one, just takes a handle to.

39
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:54,580
component which I believe can be null, as
far as I

40
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:58,230
remember, and a message that you wanna
output in a dialog.

41
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:02,950
But I actually wanna customize this a bit
more, so I'm gonna use this version here.

42
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:07,160
So the first document to the show confirm
dialog,

43
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:11,870
is gonna be, I'm gonna use the mainframe
window handle,

44
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:14,830
and because I'm in a.

45
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:19,260
Kind of anonymous, sort of inner class
here.

46
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:25,900
If I type this I'm gonna get, a handle to
the, anonymous class rather than the main

47
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:31,200
frame, so I need to cite the main frame,
do this, to get this for the main frame.

48
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:42,200
The message I'm gonna make, Do you really
want to exit the application?

49
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,070
That should do the trick.

50
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:45,750
Question mark there.

51
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:52,650
And, let's, maximize the editor here, to
get some more space.

52
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:55,670
And the title, let's.

53
00:03:55,670 --> 00:04:00,840
Put confirm, I don't know, confirm exit
should do the trick.

54
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:05,950
And then the interesting bit here is the
option type.

55
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:15,680
And I want say J Option Pane, and I want
a, let's have a.

56
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,790
A, okay button, and a cancel button.

57
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:24,540
So I'm gonna say here J Option pane, okay,
cancel option, like that.

58
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:29,310
And, put semicolon in, control shift F to
format a bit.

59
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,280
Now if I run that, Okay.

60
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,950
It's not actually gonna work at the
moment.

61
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:36,790
But if I do, control X, I get this here.

62
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:38,748
So it's got an okay and a cancel.

63
00:04:38,748 --> 00:04:41,790
And it's, nice little question mark there.

64
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:43,440
And it doesn't matter what I do now.

65
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,120
It's gonna exit.

66
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,830
So to actually make it do something, I
need to retrieve the value here.

67
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:50,829
So I'm gonna say, int.

68
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,950
Action lets call it equals the return
value of show Confine Dialog.

69
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,240
And I can check the action.

70
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:08,690
And I can say if action equals, equals J
Option Pane.

71
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:10,250
Okay, option.

72
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:15,705
So it will return okay option, if the user
clicks okay.

73
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,780
If the user clicks okay.

74
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:24,060
I'm gonna just do the system dot accept.

75
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,160
And otherwise, just ignore it.

76
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,440
So, I'll use the.

77
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,310
The accelerator and control X to bring up
the file.

78
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:36,170
X the option again, so control X.

79
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:39,190
And if I click cancel now, nothing
happens.

80
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:42,090
And if I click okay, then it quits.

81
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:43,770
So that's that.

82
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:45,950
And that's all I got use for.

83
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,330
For this application right now.

84
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:51,530
But I just want to show you the message
dialogue as well.

85
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:52,660
Which might be used shortly.

86
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:56,890
Let's just copy this bit because it looks
pretty similar.

87
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,410
And I'll just make it come up here.

88
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:00,750
Just for a minute and I'll delete it
later.

89
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,159
So, let's say show.

90
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,510
Sorry not message but input dialog.

91
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:17,420
And let's get rid of that so again, I'm
passing the handle to my parent window.

92
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,390
That's the first argument.

93
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:21,590
And then some kind of, message.

94
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,090
Let's say enter your

95
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:25,860
username.

96
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:30,536
And a title there.

97
00:06:30,536 --> 00:06:35,780
Enter username and let's

98
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:42,150
just have the okay option there and if I
run that,

99
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:47,150
and I'll just invoke it by doing control X
and you see that I've got

100
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:52,760
a little thingy where I can enter some
text here, Now this icon looks a

101
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,770
bit funny and so there are two things i
want to fix about it now.

102
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:58,270
I wanna retrieve this text and I wanna
change

103
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:01,620
that icon and this is a an arrow icon.

104
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:08,860
So lets do that by here so called J Option
Pane or Okay Option.

105
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:13,390
I kind of use a binary.

106
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:14,830
Bit wise kind of,

107
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:20,560
I can actually put another integer value
in there and just do a

108
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,880
bit wise or in it like this with a like
vertical pipe there.

109
00:07:26,138 --> 00:07:32,332
And I can say J Option Pane dot, and I
want.

110
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,380
I think it's information message.

111
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:40,440
And that's, that's just an icon

112
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:44,500
that's gonna look, appropriate for some
information.

113
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,660
So if I do that, then it would look like
this.

114
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,280
It's got an I there.

115
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,070
And other possibilities, because this
probably isn't actually what I want.

116
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:58,080
You could have for example a warning
message icon.

117
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:03,020
So, if I run that and it looks like that
it's a question mark is a tri, sorry, an

118
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:08,650
exclamation mark in a triangle and, but
the one I probably want here is.

119
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:10,340
Just the question, question message.

120
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:14,040
And i'm going get the return body from

121
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,537
that so I'm going to say string text
equals.

122
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:19,512
And that's just equals and let's do this
out here, and

123
00:08:19,512 --> 00:08:22,950
I'm going to delete the suffix, we don't
actually need this.

124
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:25,160
I just wanted to show you it working.

125
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:31,900
So if I run that then do control X to
invoke it.

126
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:32,620
Enter username.

127
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,450
You've got a nice question there.

128
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:38,810
And if I enter like, cancel then it's
gonna return null.

129
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,670
And if I run it.

130
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:50,230
And I enter okay, but don't actually type
anything in.

131
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,530
It's just going to return empty space.

132
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:57,360
And if I actually bump into something.

133
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,410
I'm going to click okay here.

134
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:05,482
Then I'm going to get text retrieved so
I'm retrieving my text now.

135
00:09:05,482 --> 00:09:11,680
And, so I just want to show you that just
to demo it, but as you can

136
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,239
see the thing is that show input dialogue
is almost the same as show input dialogue.

137
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:20,147
And the only extra trick that I've really
added

138
00:09:20,147 --> 00:09:22,990
there is, well for one thing, instead of
retrieving

139
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:25,769
the action which tells you which button is
clicked,

140
00:09:25,769 --> 00:09:28,698
you can retrieve text with a show input
dialogue call.

141
00:09:28,698 --> 00:09:34,150
And the other thing is just using this or
[INAUDIBLE] and then doing

142
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:40,040
this J Option Pane dot question, message
to change the icon there.

143
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:45,620
But apart from that it's the same as this
confirm dialogue.

144
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,140
So let's remove that because I've done
what I

145
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:50,600
wanted to do, and before I leave this
tutorial,

146
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:54,250
I just want to show you one other thing

147
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,910
that I noticed was quite funny about this
application.

148
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:01,240
Which is at the moment if I resize it like
this, the form can go

149
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:05,740
a bit mental like that, so I want to stop
it getting too small 'cause I

150
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:10,740
want there to be enough space for this
form to fit on there without it getting

151
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:15,190
warped or distorted or anything and I'm
gonna fix that just by going to my main.

152
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:16,390
Frame.

153
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:20,170
In my main frame I've already set, set
size, but what

154
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:25,160
I'm gonna do is just set a minimum size as
well.

155
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:33,710
So, set minimum size, and let's, let's try
that at 500, 400 and see how that looks.

156
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:36,950
And I thought this has to be not two,
integers.

157
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:41,860
But it has to be a new dimension and we've
seen, the dimension,

158
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:51,720
before, I think we have anyway, because,
yeah, I used it on the jpanel.

159
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,450
So, let's run that.

160
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:58,110
And if I resize that now, it will only go
to a certain minimum

161
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:02,510
size, which is what I wanted, that
protects my form from getting screwed up.

162
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,760
Okay, so that's it for this tutorial, and
in

163
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,460
the next tutorial we're gonna look at the
very exciting.

164
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:12,920
A file chooser dialog and we're going to
get a lot of functionality for free.

165
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:17,390
So I'm make use of this file menu allows
me to bring up

166
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:22,180
a file chooser dialog, where I can choose
to import or export data.

167
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:26,400
So join me again then and until next time
happy coding.
