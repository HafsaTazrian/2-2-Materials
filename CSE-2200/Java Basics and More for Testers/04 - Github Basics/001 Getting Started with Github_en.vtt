00:00.150 --> 00:07.260
In this video we will learn about GitHub, how to manage your code using GitHub, how to commit your

00:07.500 --> 00:12.630
code, how to build a repository and how to start working with GitHub.

00:13.140 --> 00:17.730
Okay, so before that you need to sign up to the GitHub.

00:18.480 --> 00:23.550
As I have already created my account, I'm signing in here with my account.

00:39.960 --> 00:40.290
Okay.

00:40.290 --> 00:42.930
So it's asking for the verification code.

00:44.790 --> 00:45.180
Okay.

00:45.570 --> 00:48.720
So these are the different records I am using.

00:48.930 --> 00:49.350
Okay.

00:49.680 --> 00:53.130
So let us go to my Jamie Dalrymple here.

00:53.640 --> 00:54.050
Okay.

00:54.060 --> 00:58.260
You can see it's inside of this project.

00:58.330 --> 01:05.640
A Jamie that is created here, you can see there are different things you can pull with as GDP.

01:05.650 --> 01:12.090
You can pull it, as I said, actually, if you have a such key configured or you can directly use those

01:12.090 --> 01:13.640
tips link also.

01:14.160 --> 01:14.570
Okay.

01:14.610 --> 01:23.400
If you don't want to use any good measure, you need a command prompt and you just use it on you.

01:23.400 --> 01:29.910
Just you, you want to use the you like, you know, comments then how to do that first letter, see,

01:29.910 --> 01:30.760
focus on that.

01:30.840 --> 01:31.150
Okay.

01:31.170 --> 01:32.310
So here is the code.

01:33.240 --> 01:36.690
You can download it in the zip format here.

01:37.140 --> 01:37.530
Okay.

01:37.830 --> 01:39.720
So let me download here.

01:41.510 --> 01:42.530
Jamie doesn't mean.

01:42.830 --> 01:48.350
So you will get all the files inside this particular zip.

01:48.920 --> 01:52.400
Now, suppose I want to add and commit something.

01:52.670 --> 01:54.560
Some files to this particular.

01:56.300 --> 01:56.910
Project.

01:56.930 --> 02:02.600
So what I will do, I'll click on to add five and then click on upload new files.

02:03.140 --> 02:06.110
Okay, and choose the file from your system.

02:07.910 --> 02:18.980
So I'll go to my performance tab and I will select one of those file HMX, which I can find currently.

02:21.160 --> 02:21.480
Jim.

02:35.380 --> 02:38.020
These are the words of the Lord the face.

02:40.350 --> 02:41.940
Adding injured here.

02:43.290 --> 02:43.650
Okay.

02:44.310 --> 02:46.740
And then I'll click on commit changes.

02:46.980 --> 02:47.370
Okay.

02:47.730 --> 02:49.860
If once I click on climate changes.

02:52.420 --> 02:55.300
See, the file is now committed here.

02:55.480 --> 02:55.810
Okay.

02:56.410 --> 03:00.240
So I have directly accessed my master branch, but.

03:01.390 --> 03:01.720
So.

03:03.340 --> 03:05.590
It gets uploaded to the massive Mac.

03:05.860 --> 03:10.120
If not, we can create the full request for a commit.

03:10.120 --> 03:10.560
And.

03:11.260 --> 03:14.200
And we can ask who has the access to master?

03:14.200 --> 03:16.570
The master branch to master file here.

03:17.410 --> 03:17.710
Okay.

03:18.010 --> 03:20.560
This is simply we can do it from the UI.

03:21.070 --> 03:25.300
Now we will go to get batch and how to do it from the command line.

03:25.300 --> 03:26.140
We will see that.

03:27.400 --> 03:27.790
Okay.

03:28.820 --> 03:34.010
So now let us download the get go mesh of good for windows.

03:34.490 --> 03:41.150
So I have time to download get to this website and now I'm down for windows.

03:42.480 --> 03:44.580
64 bit window setup.

03:52.490 --> 03:59.450
So you can just click double click on this and do next next next to install the complete set up here.

04:02.550 --> 04:07.420
When you double click on this good XY, you will get this screen.

04:07.450 --> 04:14.050
You can select options for now needs to be measured, but I'm keeping all the options.

04:14.590 --> 04:20.110
Click on next like villages that always keep the default settings.

04:20.140 --> 04:21.790
HULETT Keep in default.

04:22.570 --> 04:28.780
So I want to use get and get BASH Only not from other command line any toad by the command ends when

04:28.780 --> 04:30.160
selecting this option.

04:32.130 --> 04:33.810
Next to use as is.

04:34.440 --> 04:34.830
Yes.

04:35.520 --> 04:36.570
So we are.

04:36.570 --> 04:38.600
We can keep mostly law.

04:38.890 --> 04:41.370
Commit what style you want to commit.

04:41.370 --> 04:43.440
And all zookeeper does is.

04:45.970 --> 04:48.380
Which console you want to use.

04:48.640 --> 04:53.400
You can use this going to school or you can use Windows default console also.

04:55.060 --> 04:55.900
So yeah.

04:56.680 --> 04:56.940
Okay.

05:01.610 --> 05:02.180
In store.

05:02.750 --> 05:05.660
So now this will install the guitar for me.

05:06.440 --> 05:08.750
You also do the installation of the gift.

05:09.530 --> 05:16.400
Now, next week, how we can use the command to clone and become Itachi.

05:37.450 --> 05:40.720
And to get back and check how it looks.

05:57.710 --> 05:58.190
Okay.

05:59.420 --> 06:05.840
So first we want to clone our report here and we need to decide the part in which we want to clone it

06:05.840 --> 06:06.290
today.

06:06.620 --> 06:08.020
So I'm copying this.

06:08.020 --> 06:08.540
So.

06:10.990 --> 06:17.560
We want to clone this particular triple hate, so let it go as to type.

06:18.670 --> 06:20.500
You are for cloning.

06:22.930 --> 06:25.300
Now I need to go to a particular part.

06:25.480 --> 06:29.440
Well, I'm going to need to.

06:33.460 --> 06:34.090
See.

06:37.140 --> 06:37.380
It.

06:41.470 --> 06:42.280
Automated.

06:44.110 --> 06:44.410
Okay.

06:44.710 --> 06:45.250
So you're.

06:45.250 --> 06:46.760
I want to clone this robot.

06:46.810 --> 06:51.160
Cloning meant I want to completely put it in this particular folder.

06:51.640 --> 06:53.800
Okay, so, like, we downloaded it.

06:53.800 --> 06:58.390
Instead of that, you can clone base the you are adulthood.

06:59.090 --> 07:04.930
And so you can see here that this is cloning the gene return of all.

07:08.300 --> 07:09.530
The debate is closed.

07:09.650 --> 07:11.420
Now let's go to.

07:12.880 --> 07:13.690
See Drive.

07:15.870 --> 07:18.030
See drive way automated.

07:19.520 --> 07:21.410
And Jamie that if we should.

07:22.970 --> 07:23.320
Right.

07:23.480 --> 07:24.270
You can see this.

07:25.010 --> 07:25.310
Yes.

07:26.060 --> 07:26.480
Okay.

07:26.960 --> 07:27.740
So now.

07:28.460 --> 07:35.510
So if you check good status to check if there are any changes to this report.

07:36.800 --> 07:41.240
So no to say this is not a report that we need to go through.

07:41.510 --> 07:41.990
Jamie.

07:45.030 --> 07:54.000
So Jamie now this is at that level and we can use get go mindset get status since the brand is up to

07:54.000 --> 07:54.840
date, right.

07:55.170 --> 07:59.160
We don't have any changes in the branch to fit.

07:59.400 --> 07:59.730
Okay.

08:00.520 --> 08:07.800
So now if we have some changes, so directly down to the brand where we don't have a local report,

08:08.040 --> 08:11.580
how it looks like and how to search that, let us see that.

08:12.300 --> 08:15.810
So for that, I'll go here and add another five.

08:30.150 --> 08:30.750
Okay.

08:31.930 --> 08:32.340
It's.

08:44.110 --> 08:46.000
We're going to do it again.

09:01.050 --> 09:01.770
Idaho.

09:04.480 --> 09:12.930
Then it will show the changes that on the local level to how to will only the changes not that do that

09:12.940 --> 09:14.290
but we will check now.

09:22.210 --> 09:22.640
Okay.

09:22.670 --> 09:25.360
So I'm adding some order by your.

09:33.210 --> 09:33.530
Okay.

09:36.220 --> 09:38.350
And let's make this.

09:38.740 --> 09:45.970
We can commit to the new branch through the request of the domestic, but I'm directly committing to

09:46.660 --> 09:48.100
committing it to the master.

09:48.580 --> 09:52.510
So now if you do the this.

10:01.030 --> 10:01.890
It will show up.

10:01.900 --> 10:04.060
My current branch is up to date local.

10:04.060 --> 10:10.420
There are no changes on local, but there are changes in the variable that we know we just added today.

10:10.720 --> 10:13.540
So now we want will the changes to how to do that.

10:13.960 --> 10:16.290
You'll get that one.

10:16.900 --> 10:23.320
Now we don't need to give the link also because already cloned we cloned the report handling.

10:23.950 --> 10:28.330
So now if you do good, well only the changes will be added.

10:30.190 --> 10:34.750
See, these particular genomics is now added to our Global Report.

10:35.290 --> 10:35.720
Look.

10:37.060 --> 10:43.240
Now let's make changes to our report locally and commit to the.

10:46.090 --> 10:47.020
Cloud it up or not.

10:47.290 --> 10:47.590
Okay.

10:47.920 --> 10:51.580
So what we will do is we will create a new file inside this.

11:02.340 --> 11:03.000
New.

11:05.380 --> 11:06.940
X when it's clear that decks.

11:06.950 --> 11:07.150
Right.

11:08.620 --> 11:08.950
Okay.

11:10.520 --> 11:12.020
That's right.

11:12.740 --> 11:16.370
So this file is attached to a local report, and I want you to commit to the cloud.

11:16.760 --> 11:18.980
Now, do get deep.

11:21.480 --> 11:21.870
Okay.

11:22.200 --> 11:24.270
Now, we chose this file there.

11:24.510 --> 11:28.200
I'm just not committed to the main branch.

11:28.380 --> 11:30.480
Now, let us come with this group.

11:31.620 --> 11:33.810
First do it and not.

11:35.530 --> 11:39.040
To add this fight now to the status.

11:42.610 --> 11:43.020
30.

11:45.500 --> 11:45.960
Get.

11:48.190 --> 11:49.060
Status.

11:54.510 --> 12:04.070
So this file we added to the showing in green and defined it the mate Iceland m and is to specify the

12:04.260 --> 12:06.210
message committing.

12:07.580 --> 12:10.210
What we are committing so we can refer.

12:11.650 --> 12:13.240
Extra points.

12:14.620 --> 12:15.040
Okay.

12:17.070 --> 12:18.450
We are committing this way.

12:19.740 --> 12:24.290
And now we need to push this one to the mustard like we did from you.

12:25.170 --> 12:25.550
Okay.

12:25.770 --> 12:27.300
Now get push.

12:27.990 --> 12:28.680
What did you.

12:29.710 --> 12:30.030
Right.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.200
So you can push this file to the master.

12:37.640 --> 12:37.930
Okay.

12:37.970 --> 12:39.230
I think it's already.

12:39.230 --> 12:41.270
It's not the main.

12:44.030 --> 12:46.360
It shows me that it's coming.

12:46.390 --> 12:46.710
That.

12:50.750 --> 12:52.820
The branch name is already showing.

12:53.060 --> 12:56.370
If we want to move to any other branch, we can do good.

12:56.420 --> 12:59.840
Take out and share the name of this branch.

13:00.350 --> 13:03.600
So if you have multiple branches of your code, you can do that.

13:03.620 --> 13:06.810
You can just check out to the different branch with it.

13:06.830 --> 13:08.960
Check out the mine.

13:09.690 --> 13:09.980
Okay.

13:10.430 --> 13:14.360
Now this will push our fight to the main.

13:27.180 --> 13:29.100
So I think the formula designing.

13:35.020 --> 13:37.450
And then it is sort of push and check.

13:47.370 --> 13:50.190
So the default browser is all set today.

13:50.200 --> 13:53.700
So I need to sign up with my sign in with my GitHub here.

14:03.410 --> 14:06.050
Internet is too slow somehow to get.

14:38.790 --> 14:40.950
Key signing completed here.

14:57.110 --> 15:03.920
So now so far we have seen it how to do out of five from the UI, how to get the call from the UI,

15:03.920 --> 15:05.240
how to come back from the UI.

15:05.240 --> 15:09.080
Then similarly, we have seen from the get batch command from how to do it.

15:09.560 --> 15:16.920
But I would hope that the code, how to pull the changes how to add your files again see the got it.

15:17.030 --> 15:19.430
Now the changes are uploaded here.

15:19.670 --> 15:22.670
The same done addition to the main is done.

15:23.210 --> 15:28.520
Now let's go back to our repo here and refresher then check on file.

15:28.520 --> 15:29.630
Is there or not?

15:29.630 --> 15:31.040
The text file is added.

15:32.080 --> 15:32.380
Right.

15:32.830 --> 15:41.500
So the the message which we shared right when we were running the command so that you can see here.

15:42.310 --> 15:42.670
Okay.

15:43.480 --> 15:46.870
So this is about basic self practice of yourself.

15:46.900 --> 15:49.540
If you have any questions or doubt, you can write.

15:50.260 --> 15:50.880
And you.
