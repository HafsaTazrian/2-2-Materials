00:00.120 --> 00:03.360
In this video, we will learn about operators in Java.

00:04.050 --> 00:10.190
So let's get started with some commonly used operators that are smart operators.

00:10.200 --> 00:17.100
When you want to perform some mathematical operations, but not all that is plus minus region, modulo,

00:17.670 --> 00:27.300
etc., then other unit or unit operators that is used for incrementing the value that is plus, minus,

00:27.300 --> 00:30.320
minus or things like that.

00:30.330 --> 00:38.760
Then they're assignment operators equal to to assign a value or less equal to things and then no data

00:38.760 --> 00:46.440
relational operators and and or real excited data relational operator so greater than equal to less

00:46.440 --> 00:55.740
than equal to and that are logical operators that is an and or so these are the most commonly used operators

00:55.740 --> 00:59.910
in Java and you will learn about them with the help of example.

01:00.870 --> 01:05.790
So let's get started writing the code and using different types of operator.

01:08.100 --> 01:08.780
Okay.

01:08.790 --> 01:16.320
I'm naming this class as operators, adding the network finish.

01:18.750 --> 01:23.820
Q So first we will learn about it at home.

01:23.820 --> 01:33.360
So that is adding two integers, your E and E and of your writing.

01:34.820 --> 01:36.530
And let us add one more.

01:37.890 --> 01:39.030
That is some.

01:40.980 --> 01:41.340
Okay.

01:41.580 --> 01:44.040
Otherwise you can add it to the eight.

01:44.310 --> 01:44.610
Okay.

01:44.970 --> 01:49.910
So it is equal to A plus B.

01:52.700 --> 01:54.540
Eat less the.

01:55.720 --> 01:56.080
Okay.

01:56.710 --> 01:58.840
And we want to bring.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.830
The value of your.

02:04.710 --> 02:08.610
Systems don't out that print.

02:12.970 --> 02:14.230
Here we are printing the law.

02:16.790 --> 02:23.290
Then we need to initialize it so close to ten and 20.

02:24.890 --> 02:25.280
Okay.

02:25.760 --> 02:27.830
Now let us run this class.

02:33.780 --> 02:34.110
Okay.

02:34.620 --> 02:36.420
So see this?

02:36.780 --> 02:39.870
This plus is the arithmetic operation.

02:40.260 --> 02:43.140
And this equal two is assignment operation.

02:43.590 --> 02:45.360
So this is equal to ten.

02:45.360 --> 02:48.570
B is equal to A is an assignment operator.

02:49.020 --> 02:53.340
And now we are getting saving the value in E here.

02:53.730 --> 02:54.090
Right.

02:54.660 --> 03:00.080
Or instead of using all this so arithmetic operations we can use.

03:00.090 --> 03:04.950
So minus we can use in we can use division.

03:06.530 --> 03:08.870
We can use modular things like that.

03:09.260 --> 03:09.680
Okay.

03:09.980 --> 03:19.220
And there is also a one way to do this is that instead of writing eight is equal to E plus B, we can

03:19.220 --> 03:21.860
see it is equal to.

03:25.550 --> 03:29.790
E this to we can say like this as well.

03:30.230 --> 03:33.470
It will be it will give us the same result.

03:34.250 --> 03:36.750
This is called as an assignment operator.

03:37.880 --> 03:43.070
Instead of a plus, we can mention your two minus and run it.

03:43.880 --> 03:45.110
This will also work.

03:45.530 --> 03:47.840
It will perform A minus B.

03:49.100 --> 03:49.330
Right.

03:49.400 --> 03:50.990
That's why we're getting minus ten.

03:50.990 --> 03:54.590
It will perform E minus B and save the value inside it.

03:55.460 --> 03:58.310
We can add multiplication also here.

04:00.500 --> 04:02.930
All these are all these things.

04:03.050 --> 04:06.110
What we are trying right now is an assignment.

04:06.530 --> 04:06.950
Okay.

04:09.110 --> 04:10.060
Seen to be.

04:10.500 --> 04:10.820
Okay.

04:11.490 --> 04:20.930
So this is these are these are the assignment end all arithmetical arithmetic of three those which we

04:20.930 --> 04:21.830
have seen so far.

04:22.670 --> 04:31.400
Now, up next, coming to the next one, let's look at relational or relational operated.

04:32.210 --> 04:38.210
So for this, I want to bring the value which is smaller here.

04:38.720 --> 04:39.110
Okay.

04:39.470 --> 04:43.670
So I will add a if condition to check which one is a smaller.

04:44.060 --> 04:49.430
And to compare that I'll use relational operator if it is less then.

04:50.830 --> 04:57.430
Be okay if Liz is less than adequate to be put in doubt.

04:58.420 --> 04:59.490
Smallest pizza.

04:59.840 --> 05:01.120
E right.

05:01.120 --> 05:02.200
Let's put it in that.

05:03.510 --> 05:04.470
Smallest.

05:06.060 --> 05:06.430
If.

05:14.900 --> 05:15.170
Okay.

05:15.470 --> 05:25.940
So this this particular door operator, less than equal to which we using here isn't relational operator.

05:26.540 --> 05:27.440
So.

05:30.400 --> 05:31.720
Let us put in that.

05:34.390 --> 05:35.020
As.

05:40.350 --> 05:42.630
Bring me the smallest one.

05:44.610 --> 05:44.970
Thank.

05:47.270 --> 05:49.130
So let us run this one.

05:51.480 --> 05:58.010
Small as just the value of a we apparently think so.

05:58.410 --> 05:59.610
This is relational.

05:59.700 --> 06:04.140
Now we will go to all logical operators.

06:04.530 --> 06:04.890
Okay.

06:05.430 --> 06:10.320
So logical operators we can use when we want to add two conditions here.

06:10.920 --> 06:11.310
Okay.

06:11.790 --> 06:14.190
So I have another number.

06:14.730 --> 06:21.280
FT is equal to 70 and I want to check which one is the smallest.

06:23.160 --> 06:25.980
So if it is less, I need to be.

06:26.070 --> 06:35.670
And it is less well to see if it is less than both EMC, B and C, then it is the smallest one.

06:36.270 --> 06:36.660
Right.

06:37.670 --> 06:39.920
So in this case.

06:41.640 --> 06:44.550
Maybe we can use this and operate it here.

06:45.060 --> 06:47.910
Okay, because we want both the conditions to be two.

06:48.840 --> 06:57.600
If we want only one condition to be true and still move on, go inside the conditional statement.

06:57.600 --> 07:00.210
Then we use or operate this.

07:00.210 --> 07:09.000
If or operated, if any of the two conditions is true, then we will execute the code inside this if

07:09.000 --> 07:19.590
block and in case of and we need both the conditions must be to go inside the block.

07:20.550 --> 07:26.760
Okay so this is the difference between and interpret this and these are the logical operators.

07:27.300 --> 07:32.010
Okay, now let us learn about unity operators.

07:32.580 --> 07:40.230
So unity operator, most commonly used are plus plus or less plus or minus minus.

07:41.580 --> 07:46.230
Now we have ABC, we have initialize them with some value.

07:46.740 --> 07:50.010
Now I'm incrementing e okay.

07:50.100 --> 07:51.420
And I'm printing it.

07:56.640 --> 07:57.800
And control space.

07:57.810 --> 08:07.530
Also you going to have this system not a delivered here this is a eclipse shortcut so I have the used

08:07.530 --> 08:08.640
A-plus plus.

08:08.940 --> 08:09.420
Okay.

08:09.810 --> 08:12.000
And now I will put the value of E!

08:13.410 --> 08:18.030
Let us do B minus, minus and bring the value of B here.

08:20.810 --> 08:22.370
And let us sit on this for.

08:29.510 --> 08:29.870
Okay.

08:30.260 --> 08:33.050
So ten plus 111.

08:33.590 --> 08:35.270
20 -119.

08:36.530 --> 08:40.750
So this is how environment recruitment work in Job II.

08:40.760 --> 08:45.970
Most common use case for this is in dope deals and followed by loop.

08:45.980 --> 08:49.070
All the kind of looks that we want to increment the value.

08:49.930 --> 08:59.690
Okay, so these, these are simple examples of most commonly used operators in Java and definitely in

08:59.690 --> 09:04.550
know your problem solving your coding, you will need these operators.

09:05.000 --> 09:11.990
So pick up some more problem statements and you use this operators and try to use this operators.

09:12.740 --> 09:17.930
And in case you have any questions, you can write to me and thank you for watching.

09:18.080 --> 09:19.160
Let's get to the next.
