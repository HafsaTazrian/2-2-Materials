00:00.120 --> 00:04.830
We do what we are going to learn about loops, conditional statements in Java.

00:05.340 --> 00:13.020
So basically we are going to learn about this condition, how to use those statements, how to use different

00:13.020 --> 00:14.340
types of loops.

00:14.490 --> 00:18.150
Do loop for new file explorer.

00:18.780 --> 00:25.920
So let's get to the topic with the help of examples and about events for us.

00:26.250 --> 00:26.640
Okay.

00:27.240 --> 00:30.420
So here the hello world class itself.

00:30.420 --> 00:33.600
I'm writing this example in the main method.

00:34.170 --> 00:34.620
Okay.

00:35.040 --> 00:36.150
We will write.

00:38.040 --> 00:38.610
Simple.

00:38.880 --> 00:42.270
As if the condition is true, then.

00:44.720 --> 00:45.980
It will execute.

00:47.740 --> 00:51.850
The blow inside the if curly braces.

00:52.720 --> 00:56.140
Okay, so let's bring something here.

01:03.650 --> 01:04.380
It's Frank.

01:04.730 --> 01:05.000
So.

01:06.950 --> 01:09.170
And if it is false.

01:12.160 --> 01:18.970
If other if it is not true, that is, if it is the condition is not true, then it will execute the

01:18.970 --> 01:22.180
code in between the ethical basis.

01:34.020 --> 01:35.680
Let's stay on tape.

01:37.140 --> 01:37.530
Okay.

01:37.890 --> 01:39.270
Let's execute this.

01:53.490 --> 01:59.720
So yeah, this is how other normal is as well.

02:00.270 --> 02:05.160
Okay, now we have if else if ladder also.

02:05.700 --> 02:12.660
So we can write if as if and then as and we can write a number of conditions here.

02:13.200 --> 02:13.620
Okay.

02:14.190 --> 02:23.280
So if we take an example there or we have three numbers, maybe LC and we want to find the largest one.

02:23.910 --> 02:24.330
Okay.

02:25.760 --> 02:30.090
Do you see six, chief?

02:30.720 --> 02:30.900
Yeah.

02:33.380 --> 02:36.630
Then we can use it as ladder.

02:36.650 --> 02:36.980
Sure.

02:37.700 --> 02:43.430
So first will be if it is, but it doesn't appear to be.

02:47.070 --> 02:53.600
E and any is greater than or equal to see that means so.

02:55.650 --> 03:01.340
It is the largest number we are predicting, the largest number said.

03:01.830 --> 03:05.380
Now we need to add another condition so we will use as if.

03:06.060 --> 03:06.560
Okay.

03:07.170 --> 03:11.370
Else if B is greater than or equal to E.

03:12.210 --> 03:14.730
And B is greater than.

03:14.730 --> 03:15.660
Or equal to C.

03:17.260 --> 03:19.810
That means B is the largest number.

03:19.980 --> 03:20.940
So B.

03:22.680 --> 03:23.790
And as.

03:25.960 --> 03:27.280
Sees the largest.

03:29.620 --> 03:30.190
Right.

03:32.000 --> 03:36.650
So we are printing C here, which will basically this would bring the largest number.

03:37.070 --> 03:38.300
Now, let us run this one.

03:43.720 --> 03:44.020
Six.

03:44.500 --> 03:47.330
Sony is printing the largest number here.

03:47.680 --> 03:53.530
So this way we can write more conditions in the in the letter.

03:54.590 --> 03:55.010
Okay.

03:55.730 --> 03:58.070
Now let's move on to loops.

04:00.800 --> 04:01.190
Okay.

04:02.420 --> 04:14.480
First of all learn about for loop you're I'm taking an integer number or four and I want to bring numbers

04:14.480 --> 04:15.790
from 1 to 4.

04:16.280 --> 04:16.700
Okay.

04:17.150 --> 04:25.670
So what I will do is write the four law that in I is equal to one because I want to start my loop from

04:25.670 --> 04:28.640
one and I want to print from 1 to 4.

04:29.150 --> 04:32.660
So that is less than or equal to four.

04:34.250 --> 04:34.960
I'm blessed.

04:35.000 --> 04:39.150
Yes, but it's less than I do because I want to bring forward.

04:39.150 --> 04:40.640
So I just don't want to stop.

04:41.660 --> 04:47.870
So if I want to break one, two, three, that is n minus one, then I will write a list.

04:48.520 --> 04:48.870
Okay.

04:49.550 --> 04:51.800
So here I am writing an article.

04:52.870 --> 05:01.810
And inside that printing value I because will increment I plus will increment the value I with each

05:01.810 --> 05:02.490
iteration.

05:03.960 --> 05:09.420
So I likely knew this how this works, actually.

05:11.240 --> 05:11.600
Okay.

05:12.020 --> 05:13.410
So what will happen for us?

05:13.430 --> 05:15.260
I will be July one.

05:15.680 --> 05:18.530
It will bring the value of I.

05:18.590 --> 05:19.250
That is one.

05:20.750 --> 05:25.580
Then I will increment the value of I to two.

05:25.910 --> 05:28.010
It will check two is less than four.

05:29.270 --> 05:30.590
Let's listen in.

05:30.590 --> 05:33.710
And I mean, listen all internally, so.

05:33.740 --> 05:34.210
Yes.

05:34.510 --> 05:36.650
But then it will bring the value.

05:36.650 --> 05:43.190
If I do it, then I plus plus three of I will be initialized to trainer.

05:43.790 --> 05:51.020
Then it is checking three is less equal to through before then two it will print the value of three.

05:51.560 --> 05:54.170
Then again it will increment the AI to four.

05:54.800 --> 05:57.770
Four is less than two for two.

05:58.250 --> 06:06.920
Again it will bring forward here and then I plus plus it will be fine fine is listening to for false

06:06.920 --> 06:12.850
this condition if false and then it will not increment and we will come outside the forum.

06:13.430 --> 06:13.760
Okay.

06:14.240 --> 06:18.080
So this this is how the look will look.

06:19.690 --> 06:21.610
Let us sit on this example until.

06:26.950 --> 06:28.990
Look, this works, right?

06:29.680 --> 06:30.370
So now.

06:32.360 --> 06:33.680
I'm commenting the school.

06:33.950 --> 06:35.370
You can just go.

06:36.440 --> 06:39.770
Select board and control dash.

06:40.820 --> 06:45.640
I mean, this slash or so it will come out of the code in Java.

06:46.540 --> 06:47.890
Okay then.

06:48.280 --> 06:51.400
See now, same example we want to do.

06:51.400 --> 06:53.440
We want to bring the numbers in.

06:53.440 --> 06:57.910
But instead of following you will use different parties.

06:57.910 --> 07:07.270
We will use are doing okay do certain activities while this condition is doing okay.

07:07.600 --> 07:10.120
So it will keep on doing the activity.

07:10.360 --> 07:15.550
Whatever goal we mentioned inside this goal embraces violence.

07:15.550 --> 07:16.600
The condition is strong.

07:16.960 --> 07:21.850
Once the condition is false, it will not stop this execution and we will come up to.

07:22.720 --> 07:29.170
Okay, so for your what what condition we we have here in mind is.

07:35.660 --> 07:39.140
I just love what I do.

07:39.320 --> 07:42.710
And this is a great.

07:48.650 --> 07:49.000
All right.

07:49.730 --> 07:50.890
But we don't know why, Lou.

07:50.930 --> 07:54.920
I hear they so their destination the desire to.

07:56.650 --> 07:57.580
But here.

07:58.950 --> 08:00.750
I got to buy.

08:06.940 --> 08:07.190
Could.

08:08.130 --> 08:14.520
Then what we want to do inside everyone in the world to find and increment the value of AI here.

08:19.890 --> 08:20.130
Okay.

08:20.640 --> 08:21.330
So this is.

08:21.330 --> 08:22.650
How do I look?

08:22.770 --> 08:26.770
Looks like the code in to cure objective.

08:26.790 --> 08:30.240
The condition is true or false.

08:30.600 --> 08:33.930
If it's true, it will go on printing the number.

08:35.990 --> 08:36.310
She?

08:38.360 --> 08:38.750
Okay.

08:40.070 --> 08:43.300
So this is the we are to use.

08:43.630 --> 08:44.450
Do I look?

08:44.810 --> 08:48.470
Then there is another type of loop that is available.

08:50.400 --> 08:50.940
There.

08:50.940 --> 08:53.130
You right the condition first.

08:54.800 --> 08:56.510
And then is the.

08:59.690 --> 09:02.250
So I is listening to.

09:03.870 --> 09:04.170
And.

09:06.280 --> 09:07.440
But in this new.

09:10.340 --> 09:10.590
Okay.

09:10.940 --> 09:12.290
And increment Detroit.

09:17.420 --> 09:17.670
Okay.

09:19.250 --> 09:20.810
Now let's comment on this court.

09:24.240 --> 09:25.020
And on this.

09:30.120 --> 09:30.430
See.

09:31.350 --> 09:38.550
So these are most commonly used loops in Java and this is how it works when you want to specify the

09:38.550 --> 09:40.800
condition for the execution.

09:41.850 --> 09:51.810
You can use this and then you want to check the condition or and then you first you check the condition.

09:51.810 --> 09:53.670
I'm with the condition as well.

09:53.950 --> 09:55.650
You can also.

09:56.620 --> 09:57.000
Okay.

09:57.360 --> 10:03.190
So this is about conditional statements if as if a slider.

10:04.020 --> 10:06.420
Oh, you can also use this steady.

10:06.750 --> 10:11.160
So instead, if the condition you can add another condition.

10:11.160 --> 10:14.700
So you can you can make that as a good one also.

10:15.090 --> 10:18.450
So I can show you that if it is that.

10:24.830 --> 10:27.230
We need to add one more condition here.

10:32.950 --> 10:35.230
And here you can add a little else.

10:36.280 --> 10:41.110
That is the end of a three year or else, and it's okay.

10:41.740 --> 10:45.430
So this is also a valid scenario.

10:45.490 --> 10:51.160
Then you want to add another condition inside your if condition.

10:51.370 --> 10:53.200
So that is also possible.

10:54.250 --> 11:02.080
So practise this with different examples so you can find simple coding examples in Java as a problem

11:02.080 --> 11:06.130
statement and you can solve them by utilizing this.

11:06.130 --> 11:08.260
So conditionals and loops.

11:09.250 --> 11:13.060
Okay, so thank you for watching this live move on to the next more.
