00:00.090 --> 00:04.290
This video we will learn about multi dimensional array with an example.

00:04.950 --> 00:10.620
So suppose we have an array declared with this variable name.

00:11.670 --> 00:14.850
We have three indexes in the array.

00:14.850 --> 00:20.940
That means we have specified the land of the early as three, but it is a multi dimensional.

00:20.940 --> 00:22.620
That is it is a to the early.

00:22.830 --> 00:23.220
Okay.

00:23.580 --> 00:30.030
So each index of the array stores three values here.

00:30.600 --> 00:38.130
So it will be a three by three adding date three location three values.

00:38.130 --> 00:41.310
So to itself to dimensional Larry, which is three by three.

00:41.940 --> 00:50.250
First index will have this value to seven 9/2 index will have this value three, six one and a third

00:50.250 --> 00:54.300
one will have this value seven forward two okay.

00:54.720 --> 01:00.960
So the code, let us see how we can initialize this type of multidimensional array, how we can assign

01:00.960 --> 01:03.750
value to it in how you can access this value.

01:04.440 --> 01:05.550
So let's get started.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.140
So this is an example of multi dimensional early.

01:09.180 --> 01:11.880
We are specifying a two dimensional array.

01:11.880 --> 01:18.390
This two square basis specify a square basis specified that this is up to date.

01:18.720 --> 01:27.600
Okay and the value of index since hero value of index one and value of index two is this.

01:27.840 --> 01:30.690
So the length of the array will be three here.

01:31.320 --> 01:31.680
Okay.

01:32.040 --> 01:36.240
So we are writing a for a loop starting from 0 to 3.

01:36.750 --> 01:37.140
Okay.

01:37.410 --> 01:45.870
And again, we will add another for loop here starting from 0 to 3 like we need to for loops here because

01:45.870 --> 01:47.420
it's a two dimensional Larry.

01:47.880 --> 01:48.330
Okay.

01:48.540 --> 01:54.720
So it's now it can be two by four, it can be three by three can be three by eight.

01:55.230 --> 01:59.670
So these are in g values can be different, upper limit can be different.

01:59.670 --> 02:07.320
But in this particular example, it's a C, that's why the oh for loop here shows that the same value

02:07.320 --> 02:17.250
you will get and we need to specify the value, but in the value of I and G in this date and we are

02:17.250 --> 02:21.320
printing the value of this particular idea.

02:21.960 --> 02:35.160
Okay, so this is I consider this is g we want to make I increment g101 to bring the value, then we

02:35.160 --> 02:38.490
want to increment the eight to the next.

02:38.910 --> 02:45.960
Again, we want to initialize g0g to one g to do okay.

02:46.350 --> 02:55.680
Then again, we want to increment the I do to date and g to zero, g to one and D to three.

02:56.430 --> 02:56.760
Okay.

02:57.210 --> 03:03.180
And then we will print this value and again increment I and then it will be three.

03:03.180 --> 03:07.530
Three is less than three false and then it will stop printing the value.

03:07.860 --> 03:14.970
So this is how we can we the use too far looks here to bring that two dimensional three.

03:16.110 --> 03:19.590
Okay, so let's run this and check.

03:26.940 --> 03:33.600
3279361742.

03:34.860 --> 03:38.610
Like you did all these early values that bring you.

03:40.070 --> 03:40.430
Okay.

03:41.270 --> 03:47.660
Also, I have to inform you that we can pass this audit as an input to a method.

03:48.080 --> 03:48.440
Okay.

03:48.770 --> 03:58.340
What I meant by that, it's like if you're adding another mental HULETT public void and one that is

03:58.420 --> 04:05.930
pentathlon and you want to pass it in as a barometer, you can do that.

04:06.350 --> 04:06.710
Okay.

04:07.520 --> 04:16.910
And if you want to return an audit as a barometer, then also you can do that instead of very well.

04:17.120 --> 04:19.970
Why do you can use this and return?

04:22.110 --> 04:22.620
Audie.

04:28.710 --> 04:29.070
Okay.

04:42.320 --> 04:42.570
Okay.

04:43.070 --> 04:45.800
In this way, you can return a particular area.

04:46.190 --> 04:50.900
You can specify the added ingredient.

04:50.900 --> 04:51.860
Exactly.

04:52.280 --> 04:53.570
So this is possible with.

04:58.930 --> 04:59.320
Okay.

05:01.150 --> 05:07.000
Now, next Monday, we will see array of objects how to create a ray of object and utilize them.

05:07.330 --> 05:07.660
Okay.

05:08.980 --> 05:10.150
So that's it for this module.

05:10.150 --> 05:11.620
Try it yourself.

05:11.980 --> 05:17.380
To use this example for multidimensional learning, let me know if you face any doubts.
