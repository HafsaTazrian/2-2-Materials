00:00.090 --> 00:04.500
Basic structure of Dharma Buddhism, the hallowed program.

00:04.890 --> 00:08.460
So start writing your first program here with me.

00:09.210 --> 00:15.140
First of all, I have already shared a video on how to install Eclipse.

00:15.210 --> 00:23.870
Once you have installed Eclipse, you should go to file new and approach Java project.

00:25.080 --> 00:28.650
Once you had your project, you can add a package.

00:28.680 --> 00:34.490
You will see the facade, see a folder here, and you can start adding your package.

00:35.490 --> 00:38.440
Like this one sample could look.

00:39.360 --> 00:46.260
So I have added this package and let this start adding a new class here.

00:51.610 --> 00:56.970
Q So what is the name of the class is the latest?

00:58.610 --> 00:59.120
What?

01:02.370 --> 01:09.790
You want to have a public static word metal in that if you want to add construct those superclass inherited

01:09.810 --> 01:12.660
abstract plans, you can select those kind of things.

01:13.290 --> 01:15.510
So for now, we just run the main matter.

01:16.380 --> 01:18.810
I'll explain why you want this particular method.

01:20.510 --> 01:23.570
So as you know, Jeb is a glass bit language.

01:24.050 --> 01:26.990
Every line of code is written inside glass.

01:29.620 --> 01:30.130
Okay.

01:30.130 --> 01:33.190
So you can see here the classes ended.

01:33.580 --> 01:33.900
Okay.

01:35.440 --> 01:43.090
So as you know, we can argue and declare variables inside the plaza can add metals, oil or constructors,

01:43.090 --> 01:46.330
all the colors done inside the class.

01:46.990 --> 01:50.350
And this is public static would mean is the matter.

01:50.800 --> 01:54.190
From there, the execution of Java code starts.

01:54.460 --> 01:54.860
Okay.

01:55.240 --> 01:58.470
So this is the triggering point for Java code.

01:58.840 --> 02:02.380
So this method acts like the triggering point.

02:02.920 --> 02:06.730
Now what I want to do is I want to just the blueprint.

02:06.730 --> 02:07.450
Hello world.

02:07.750 --> 02:08.050
Right.

02:08.740 --> 02:12.640
So this public stand for the network, which is public.

02:13.300 --> 02:15.430
It's that big white.

02:15.490 --> 02:17.920
That means it doesn't return anything.

02:17.920 --> 02:21.880
If I write in integer here, then it will return.

02:21.880 --> 02:24.070
An integer will expect to return.

02:24.240 --> 02:34.090
Doing nothing is there to return it versus an argument in a string array format in case we want to take

02:34.150 --> 02:34.780
an input.

02:36.800 --> 02:37.280
Okay.

02:38.390 --> 02:40.870
So let's start writing the system.

02:41.690 --> 02:42.650
Look out.

02:46.860 --> 02:47.240
But.

02:47.270 --> 02:47.760
But in.

02:50.050 --> 02:52.960
Will help us bring anything under control.

02:53.770 --> 02:56.250
Okay, so let's bring.

02:56.500 --> 02:57.340
And what?

03:03.520 --> 03:04.090
Okay.

03:06.190 --> 03:06.490
See.

03:07.710 --> 03:09.600
So this is all in moodle.

03:09.630 --> 03:17.070
Method system to download print deliver and to run this model you can either select the platform or

03:17.070 --> 03:21.930
you can select a few it right click then as.

03:23.820 --> 03:24.840
Job application.

03:28.550 --> 03:31.550
So you will get the result in the console.

03:31.550 --> 03:31.910
Should.

03:35.050 --> 03:35.680
Hello World.

03:37.090 --> 03:37.750
That's it.

03:38.020 --> 03:45.420
So this is the this is how you can start writing your code, create your class, and add your main method

03:45.430 --> 03:46.930
and start writing your code.

03:47.650 --> 03:49.330
So that's it for this video.

03:49.450 --> 03:51.010
Let's move on to next model.

03:51.730 --> 03:53.170
This is a class.

03:53.560 --> 03:58.420
Let us see the example of some of the primitive data types with the code.

03:59.290 --> 04:08.260
So this is a data type class that I've added the top and we're using data type, boolean, boolean can

04:08.260 --> 04:10.930
hold two values, true and false.

04:11.410 --> 04:13.150
So here it is.

04:13.180 --> 04:16.120
In the logic, we are initializing B to two.

04:16.540 --> 04:20.260
And if B is true, then representing high and this.

04:26.300 --> 04:27.830
It will show high geeks.

04:28.130 --> 04:32.120
Right now I am making the value of be as a false right.

04:32.630 --> 04:39.050
Then it gets off that this will not get printed instead.

04:41.150 --> 04:42.880
I will bring this.

04:44.170 --> 04:44.530
Right.

04:48.020 --> 04:48.200
Oh.

04:54.400 --> 04:55.750
It does run this.

05:00.190 --> 05:00.450
Yeah.

05:00.700 --> 05:01.630
It's printing this.

05:01.630 --> 05:01.930
Hello.

05:02.800 --> 05:07.750
So let's take another example here for some of the primitive data types.

05:08.170 --> 05:11.110
So here we are declaring a character.

05:11.980 --> 05:14.200
This is in is for integer.

05:14.800 --> 05:21.640
We can just give the data type name, go the variable name and its value.

05:22.880 --> 05:27.140
Indigenous numeric value bite holds bite.

05:27.140 --> 05:31.460
In short, if memory is a constraint, then you can use this particular detective.

05:33.000 --> 05:37.350
This will give Ed Asner what is larger than the bite range.

05:37.650 --> 05:38.100
Okay.

05:38.490 --> 05:42.510
So if the memories are constant, then you can use this data, right?

05:42.900 --> 05:43.830
That is a short.

05:45.070 --> 05:50.160
This will give error as is the number larger than short range, this range.

05:51.030 --> 05:58.380
So if you want to use fractional numbers, you can use float and double and girlfriend doing all this

05:58.380 --> 05:59.880
so variable.

05:59.970 --> 06:00.300
Sure.

06:00.330 --> 06:02.820
So let's run this example and also.

06:10.650 --> 06:11.180
Okay.

06:11.610 --> 06:12.180
So.

06:13.270 --> 06:16.990
Chicago teachers might short and double.

06:17.920 --> 06:22.300
So these are some of the optimal pacing, non primitive data type.

06:22.300 --> 06:30.940
So as we go ahead in dozens of strings and arrays currently, let's focus on the primitive data types

06:30.940 --> 06:39.940
and try to utilize in your code different types of data types and so you can practice that in this way.

06:40.660 --> 06:44.670
So that said about data types, let's move on to the next part.
