00:00.120 --> 00:06.480
It is in this video we will see about a for object, how we can create a real thin object.

00:06.900 --> 00:11.740
So to create object, we already know Java is object oriented language.

00:12.120 --> 00:19.170
All the code is specified in dozens of different classes and we create the object of this class to access

00:19.170 --> 00:21.540
the same class in another class.

00:21.690 --> 00:22.020
Right?

00:22.680 --> 00:29.070
So with that, we will see how we can create this particular class that is a student class.

00:29.580 --> 00:29.970
Okay.

00:30.270 --> 00:37.470
In the student class, we have a public variable that is integer that little number and we have a public

00:37.470 --> 00:39.420
string variable which is name.

00:40.110 --> 00:40.530
Okay.

00:40.530 --> 00:42.840
And this is a constructor of the class.

00:42.840 --> 00:47.960
What is a constructor and a main, main features of constructor?

00:47.960 --> 00:53.820
We will learn that in the upcoming videos, but for now, just remember we have created the constructor

00:53.820 --> 01:01.260
and we are passing this value and this assigns the value to this variable of the class.

01:01.470 --> 01:01.890
Okay.

01:02.220 --> 01:06.870
So constructor is used for initializing the value for this particular variable.

01:07.350 --> 01:11.220
Okay, now let's move on to the array object.

01:11.330 --> 01:16.890
Plus we are making the array of this class like this student.

01:17.160 --> 01:24.360
Okay, so see instead of int character data type we have specified here.

01:24.780 --> 01:27.720
Student Because we are creating a early on.

01:27.720 --> 01:35.460
Student Today, then we initialize it to five like the length of the array will be five.

01:36.240 --> 01:40.560
Then as per indexes we are adding the values here.

01:41.190 --> 01:43.050
So what values it is expecting?

01:43.350 --> 01:51.750
Let us check again once is expecting growing them but any rate, so it is expecting rule number one

01:51.960 --> 01:52.410
name.

01:53.100 --> 01:59.760
Okay, so this way we are specifying values for all the indexes that the 0 to 4 as the size of that

01:59.760 --> 02:00.300
is five.

02:00.850 --> 02:01.120
Okay.

02:02.340 --> 02:09.870
Now we will bring the values as we are done in the previous example, same the with the index if you

02:09.870 --> 02:15.180
will be accessing 0 to 4 and we will be printing the rule number here.

02:15.720 --> 02:19.920
So a reader either rule number, listener either name.

02:21.060 --> 02:21.410
Right.

02:21.750 --> 02:25.020
So this is how you can initialize the object.

02:26.230 --> 02:33.810
Oh you can say declare the array of object, you can initialize the array of object, you can specify

02:33.810 --> 02:34.620
the value.

02:35.130 --> 02:41.130
And this is how you can access particular element in the order.

02:41.790 --> 02:44.280
Now let us run this example and check.

02:49.410 --> 02:49.820
Okay.

02:50.580 --> 02:52.140
See, it is showing.

02:52.590 --> 02:55.260
And what index, what value is present here?

02:56.130 --> 02:56.520
Okay.

02:56.850 --> 03:00.720
This is how simple it is to create a create a class.

03:00.720 --> 03:07.890
And you can create an array of that array of object of that class and utilize it in your code.

03:08.520 --> 03:10.160
Okay, so try this out.

03:10.290 --> 03:20.290
These are very important concepts in Java and you will be needing this a lot in overriding your, you

03:20.400 --> 03:22.650
know, test food and things like that.

03:22.650 --> 03:26.960
And there are a lot of use cases also where you can use a raise in jobs.

03:27.240 --> 03:34.890
Okay, so focus on this topic and if you have any doubt or you can ask me and I'd suggest try it yourself.

03:35.310 --> 03:42.520
All these examples, try it yourself so you can have a hands on experience like you are learning.

03:43.230 --> 03:43.500
Okay.

03:44.250 --> 03:45.330
So thank you for watching.

03:45.600 --> 03:46.650
Let's get to the next.
