00:00.660 --> 00:10.890
So before starting to code let us install java so to and download Java.

00:14.380 --> 00:15.690
Each of our downloads.

00:20.790 --> 00:21.090
Okay.

00:22.650 --> 00:23.970
Then let us down.

00:24.150 --> 00:26.010
Delete this two words and hear it.

00:28.010 --> 00:30.020
Download job for Windows.

00:30.550 --> 00:31.910
This is for Linux.

00:33.780 --> 00:37.140
This is for Linux Windows.

00:38.580 --> 00:39.270
Soon it is.

00:39.300 --> 00:40.530
Click on Windows here.

00:41.550 --> 00:46.440
And yes, that's down Java from here.

00:46.980 --> 00:49.710
Once you download, just double click on it.

00:50.430 --> 00:52.080
And next.

00:52.080 --> 00:53.820
Next, next install the java.

00:54.420 --> 00:58.830
Once you install the java, I need to set the environment apart here.

00:59.460 --> 01:09.990
So for that, go to your search bar, type that and then derivative this so you can see edit system

01:09.990 --> 01:11.310
and environmental variables.

01:12.000 --> 01:12.900
Click on it.

01:16.780 --> 01:17.260
Okay.

01:18.400 --> 01:24.460
So here in environment variables, you will have to abate the part for Java home.

01:26.040 --> 01:27.180
You need to beat.

01:28.740 --> 01:29.310
For Java.

01:30.210 --> 01:37.290
And then in light variable to edit and give the part of o java.

01:38.700 --> 01:38.990
Bill?

01:39.000 --> 01:42.870
B Well, get this part is not Bill.

01:43.170 --> 01:47.270
You can see here like this, but you know it still.

01:48.120 --> 01:49.950
So once you set up the part.

01:51.410 --> 01:55.190
You can have a quick restart of your system.

01:57.580 --> 01:58.790
And that's it.

01:58.810 --> 02:04.180
We have java installed so to check if it is properly installed or not.

02:04.540 --> 02:06.550
That is good coming from pure.

02:09.240 --> 02:14.880
And then the type Java Python version.

02:17.970 --> 02:19.080
This will give you.

02:21.220 --> 02:22.450
The job one should.

02:23.260 --> 02:23.640
Yes.

02:23.650 --> 02:31.360
If you are getting the Java version, hear that mentor java is successfully installed so do this installation.

02:31.360 --> 02:35.890
But and next to the model you will install eclipse.
