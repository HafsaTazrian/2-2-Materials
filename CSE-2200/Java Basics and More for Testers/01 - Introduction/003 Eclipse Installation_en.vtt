00:00.330 --> 00:04.710
Let's go to Google Light download Eclipse.

00:07.700 --> 00:09.680
Let us click on this link.

00:10.040 --> 00:11.780
Well, it's the link which you get.

00:20.600 --> 00:22.100
Click download Eclipse.

00:33.990 --> 00:37.470
So we want to try to write our dialogue.

00:40.480 --> 00:42.520
We can use other ideas also.

00:43.360 --> 00:46.360
But in this I will be using Eclipse.

00:47.990 --> 00:54.710
So if you click here, you will get the downloaded downloaded file.

00:57.560 --> 00:58.550
This is the file.

00:59.180 --> 00:59.650
Okay.

01:03.200 --> 01:05.600
And I click that and as administrator.

01:10.150 --> 01:10.810
Next.

01:11.140 --> 01:11.590
Next.

01:11.620 --> 01:12.060
Next.

01:12.070 --> 01:14.920
You need to do the default configurations.

01:15.340 --> 01:17.440
Annular eclipse will be installed.

01:19.460 --> 01:23.870
So that's it for Eclipse installation, the next to Star Trek.
