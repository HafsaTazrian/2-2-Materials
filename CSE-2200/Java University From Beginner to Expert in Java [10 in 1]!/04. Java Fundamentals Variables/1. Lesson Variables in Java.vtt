00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:15.620
hello my name is Ubaldo Acosta
welcome again I hope you're ready to

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:23.300
start this with lesson, we will study the
concept of variables in Java. This is the

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.310
basis for the management of information
when creating our programs in Java. Are

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:38.800
you ready? let's begin. Variables in Java

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:49.309
in Java, as in any programming language
to store information is necessary to

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:54.440
create variables, which will allow us to
store data from our program temporarily

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:00.049
the objective of declaring a variable is
to reserve memory space depending on the

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:05.210
type that we are going to use. This
variables also allows to make dynamic

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.010
programs so in most cases the values
will change during the interaction with

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:15.440
the user and the program for example as we
can see in the figure we have data which

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.690
can be changing throughout execution of
our program. In Java there are different

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:26.330
types of data, so we will study in more
detail the types of data and therefore

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.950
the types of variables that we need to
create to store a specific type of data

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:43.820
so let's continue. Types in Java. We have
primitive types and referenced types

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:52.250
object types, and in primitive types we
have int types and float types and in

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:58.430
reference we have Classes, Interfaces and
Arrays. There is a wide classification

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.560
regarding the types that are handled in
Java, however we can summarize it in the

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.080
figures shown. In one hand we have
primitive types, and on the other hand we

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.450
have the types that are considered as
extensions of the object class, also

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.879
known as reference to objects. Regarding
the primitive types we can classify them

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:24.920
in integer and floating types
however we also have the boolean type

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.500
each of these types we will see them in
more details below. On the other side we

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.480
have the types object which can be
classes interfaces or arrays in Java

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.940
we will study these types in the topic
of classes and objects in Java so for

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.890
now we will focus on primitive types and
how to declare them and use this type of

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:53.090
data in Java. We have primitive data
types in Java and are classified as

00:02:53.090 --> 00:03:00.770
integer types and flow types and we have
the next integer types by it which has

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:09.200
eight bits
short which occupies 16 bits, char which

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:16.640
occupies 16 bits too, int which has 32
bits long

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:27.260
which has 64 bits and in float types we
have the float type which has 32 bits

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:36.799
and double which has 64 bits the boolean
type in Java is also a primitive type

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:42.620
and can store only the value of true or
false its default value is false let's

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:50.239
see the default values for every data
type. The default value for byte is 0, for

00:03:50.239 --> 00:04:02.840
short is 0, for char is the 0, but in
unicode, for int is 0, for long is 0, for

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:11.090
float is 0.0 and for double is 0.0. As we
discussed earlier, we have different

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:16.669
types of data in Java, in total there are
8, these types of Java are the most basic

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:21.680
and are those that we will use if we
need the fastest and most resource

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.530
saving with the aim of making our
algorithms as efficient as possible

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:32.720
however in practice we will also use
already creative functions that can make

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.529
in directive use of these primitive
types so in any

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:41.349
case we will be managing them in our
programs either directly or indirectly

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:46.729
each of these primitive types has a
default value which is important to know

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:52.249
since when we use them together with our
Java classes the compiler will take into

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:58.849
account this value by default according
to the type of data we use. In the figure

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:04.459
we can see both the number of bits that
each data occupies as well as the

00:05:04.459 --> 00:05:09.469
default values that are assigned to each
type when they are used as attributes

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:15.199
for classes in Java. Later we will create
several exercises to put into practice

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:19.689
the use of primitive types in Java
