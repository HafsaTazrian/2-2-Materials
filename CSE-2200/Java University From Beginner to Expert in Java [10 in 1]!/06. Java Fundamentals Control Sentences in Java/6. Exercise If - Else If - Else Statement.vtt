00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.289
exercise if-else if-else statement

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.419
exercise objective create a program to
implement the use of if-else if-else

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:31.630
structure at the end we should observe
the following create a new project

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:42.010
called if-else if-else so click on file
new project select java java application

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:52.329
click on next the project name is IfElse
IfElse the project location is lesson04

00:00:52.329 --> 00:01:06.610
and we click on finish so the project
has the desired structure create a new

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:19.000
class called if-else if-else test the
class name is IfElseIfElseTest and

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.329
the package name is test click on finish

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:36.820
modify the code the package name is test
the name of the class is IfElseIfElseTest

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:45.600
we create a main method, declare a
variable called x equals to 30 of type

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:53.770
int and we use the if statement to check
if the variable x is equal to 10 in

00:01:53.770 --> 00:02:01.659
that case we will print x equals to 10
if not we execute the next statement in

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:12.520
this case the else if so we check again
if x is equal to 20 we print x equals to

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:19.510
20 and we can add as many
statements as we need of type else if in

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.360
this case we add another statement
x

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:31.630
equals to 30 and print x equals to 30 and to
finish we can use the else statement we

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:39.820
print x is not equal to 10 20 or 30 and
we close the else statement as we have

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.410
mentioned before we can omit the curly
braces if we have only one sentence

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.980
inside the if or else if or else 
statement if we have more sentences

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:56.860
inside of any of these blocks of code we
need to use the curly braces we close

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.260
the main method and we close the class

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.760
we execute the project so right-click
on the class if-else if-else test run

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:20.460
file and the result in this case x
equals to 30 so with this exercise

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:27.800
we have put into practice the handling
of the if-else if-else statement
