Exercise if-else statement. Exercise
objective: Create a program to implement

1
00:20.500 --> 00:26.640
the use of the if-else structure at the
end we should observe the following

2
00:29.660 --> 00:37.880
create a new project called if-else
example so click on file new project

3
00:38.040 --> 00:47.940
select java, java application and click
on next. The project name is IfElseExample

4
00:47.940 --> 00:53.100
and the project location is lesson04 and click on finish

5
00:54.390 --> 00:58.920
so the project has the desired structure

6
00:59.820 --> 01:09.220
we create a new class called IfElseTest.java so the class name is

7
01:09.220 --> 01:17.680
IfElseTest the package name is test
and click on finish. We modify the code

8
01:17.680 --> 01:26.049
of the class IfElseTest the package is
test we define the class IfElseTest

9
01:26.049 --> 01:34.960
and we add the main method. We define a
variable called x equals to 30 of type int

10
01:34.960 --> 01:44.640
and we use the if statement. If x is less
than 20 we print x is less than 20 and

11
01:44.640 --> 01:51.579
we add the structure else, it means if
not the application will print X greater

12
01:51.579 --> 01:56.890
than 20 because we are using only one
sentence inside the if and else

13
01:56.890 --> 02:03.009
statement we can omit the use of curly
braces we close the main method and we

14
02:03.009 --> 02:10.570
close the class. We execute the project so
right click on the IfElseTest class and

15
02:10.570 --> 02:19.660
click on run file and the result is as
follows so the result is x greater than

16
02:19.660 --> 02:22.210
20 because the expression of the
if

17
02:22.210 --> 02:28.150
statement was false so the else
structure was executed that's why we can

18
02:28.150 --> 02:35.080
see the result X greater than 20.
Exercise Conclusion: With this exercise

19
02:35.080 --> 02:40.600
we have put into practice the handling of
the else if statement, we will do some

20
02:40.600 --> 02:45.600
more exercises regarding the topic of
control sentences
