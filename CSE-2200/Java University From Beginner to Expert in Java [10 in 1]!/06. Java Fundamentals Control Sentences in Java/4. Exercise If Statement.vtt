Exercise. if Statement. Exercise
objective. Create a program to implement

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:29.810
the use of the if structure at the end
we should observe the following. We will

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:39.260
create a new project called if example
so click on file, new project, select Java

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.200
and Java application and click on next

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:52.280
the project is called if example the project
location is courses, Java fundamentals

00:00:52.280 --> 00:01:07.880
lesson04 and click on finish. So the
project has a desired structure. Create a

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.280
new class called IfTest so right click
on the if example project select new and

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:24.620
select Java class. The class name is IfTest and the package name is test, click

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:34.250
on finish and we modify the code of this
class the package name is test the class

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:41.990
name is IfTest and we create a main
method after that we add a comment: If

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:50.090
Example. We declare a variable called x
with value 10 of type int, after that we

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:57.799
use the if structure and we are checking
if the variable x is less than 20 if

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:07.189
that is true we will log into the
console x less than 20. We are not

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:12.200
using the else structure yet, we are only
putting into practice the if structure

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:18.560
as we are using only one sentence inside
the if structure it's optional to use

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.260
the curly braces of the if statement

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:31.610
we run the project as shown and the
result we can see: x is less than

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:39.770
20 because the evaluation of the
expression was true. Exercise conclusion

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.490
with this exercise we have put into
practice the handling of the if

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:51.640
statement. We will do more exercises
regarding the issue of control sentences
