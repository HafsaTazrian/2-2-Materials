00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.280
Another way to make decisions is to use the
switch control structure, which, as the name

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:22.660
implies, is like using a switch.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:31.670
Unlike the if / else structure, the switch
structure will be used more when we have,

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:33.540
for example, an options menu.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.629
For example, if we have 5 options, and each
of them performs a different action, then

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.690
the switch structure is ideal to handle these
decisions.

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:49.049
The switch structure is less used than the
if / else control structure, however it will

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:54.540
be useful for more specific questions when
making decisions as we will see in the following

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.120
example.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.540
We can observe the syntax of the switch structure.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:14.640
In versions prior to jdk 7, only these values were
supported in the expression to be evaluated

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.650
for example the type byte, short, int or char, and from
version jdk 7 onwards, the type String is

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.930
also supported, although it is not a primitive
type , is one of the Object types that we

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.080
will use the most.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.640
Once the evaluation of each of the cases 
begins, one or more cases separated by colon

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.520
may be included.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:40.730
The word break is used so that the flow is
held and the evaluation of the other cases

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:46.850
is finished, if we do not place it, the evaluation
of each case will be followed.

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:52.979
Finally, the word default is used to execute
a block of code, if none of the cases coincided

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.100
in its evaluation.
