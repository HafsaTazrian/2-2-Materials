00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:18.910
Exercise: Calculate Season
if example. Create an exercise to put

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:24.689
into practice the if-else statement at
the end we should observe the following

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.430
we create a new project the name of the
project is CalculateMonthIf so we create

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.899
a new project click on file new project

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:48.980
select Java and Java application click
on next the project name is CalculateSeasonIf

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:56.859
and the project location is lesson04
and click on finish. We will create a new

00:00:56.859 --> 00:01:01.589
class called CalculateSeasonIfTest

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.500
the class name is CalculateSeasonIfTest
the package name is test and click on

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:19.469
finish. We will modify the code as shown
below the package name is test the

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:28.630
public class is calculate season if test
and we create a main method with a clear

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.789
a variable called month equal to 1 we
will use this variable to represent the

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:38.969
month of the year we declare a
variable called season of type a string

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:48.100
and we check using the if structure if
month is equal to 1 or month is equal to

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:56.799
2 or month is equal to 12
the season is equal to winter, we

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:03.189
can add and else if structure to check
other months in this case if month is

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:11.940
equal to 3 or month is equal to 4 or
month is equal to 5 the season is spring

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:21.129
in a similar way we can check else if
month is equal to 6 7 or 8 the season is

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:27.370
equal to summer
and we can check if the month is equal

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:36.550
to 9 10 or 11 the season is equal to
autumn in any other case the season is

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:43.990
equal to incorrect month and finally we
print the season of the month is and we

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:49.060
use the variables month and season to
print every variable that we need so in

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:54.850
this case because we are initializing
the month variable to 1 the month will

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:00.100
enter to the if statement and the season
will be equal to winter but we can

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:05.410
modify the value of month from 1 to 12
to check every case that we have

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:12.000
programmed in this application we finish
the main method and we close the class

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:20.620
we execute the project so right click on
the class and Run File so as we have

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:26.530
seen in the program the season for the
month 1 is winter but you can test every

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:36.040
month from 1 to 12 to check the season
of every month with this exercise we are

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:41.290
put into practice the handling of the if
structure next we will implement the

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.700
switch structure in Java

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.940
you
