Hello
Ubaldo Acosta greets you again. I hope

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.009
you're ready to start with this lesson
we're going to study the topic of

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:25.390
control statements in Java are you ready
let's go. Through our life we live making

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.610
decisions, decision like what career to
study?, what job to choose?, to marry

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:36.430
or not to marry? have children? start
saving at an early age, among many more

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:44.170
decisions. In the same way when we are
solving a computational problem we face

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:53.170
decision making and this is what we'll
study in this lesson. Decisions exists in

00:00:53.170 --> 00:01:01.899
any modern programming language, since
they are the basis for the flow that we

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:06.340
define in the solution of a problem. To
handle this concept we are going to use

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.920
the if control structure with this we
will ask the question if this is true

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:18.189
then do this, we can also use the word
else so that in case that question is

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:23.920
not true then do something else. The
basic structure is shown in the figure

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:29.850
the if-else structure can be combined to
generate more complex cases for example

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:36.969
using if-else if-else the idea is to be
able to add decisions according to the

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:43.030
cases that arise when solving a problem,
also the if-else structure may have

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.729
nested statements that is one if within
another. We will put this into practice

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:55.840
as we progress through the course. In the
figure we can see the syntax that is

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.240
used in Java when using the if-else a
structure. To start a condition is

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.950
evaluated if this is true then the
instructions contained in that block of

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:12.490
code are executed. A block of code in the
if structure can be bracket or not, we

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.629
can do this in order to delimit the
statements or instructions that the if

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:21.970
should execute, in the event that curly
brackets are not used then only one

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.120
state
can be added after the world if. In

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.790
addition the else section is optional
being able to have only the part of the

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.870
if to execute the desired logic. We can
see in the figure they must command

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:40.060
syntax when using the if-else structure
and later we will do some exercises to

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.590
put the syntax into practice
