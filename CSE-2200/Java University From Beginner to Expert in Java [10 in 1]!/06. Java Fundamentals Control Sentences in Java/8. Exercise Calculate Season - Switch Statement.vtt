00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:16.990
exercise calculate season using the
switch structure

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.580
create an exercise to put into practice
the switch statement at the end we

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:32.369
should observe the following so we will
create a new project called calculate

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.130
MonthSwitch so click on file new project

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:47.640
select Java Java application and click
on next the project name is calculate

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:57.900
SeasonSwitch and the project location is
less04 and click on finish create a

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:04.380
new class called CalculateSeasonSwitchTests so the name of the class is

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:11.149
calculate season switch tests and the
package name is test click on finish

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.990
modify the code CalculateSeasonSwitchTest the package name is test the class

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:25.110
name is CalculationSeasonIfTest we create a
main method to execute our application

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:32.130
the execute our class we define a variable
called month in this case the initial

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:39.119
value is equal to 11 and this variable
represents the month of the year we

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.970
define a variable called season and
instead of using the if-else statement

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.490
we will be using the switch statement so
we pass as a parameter the month in the

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.189
switch statement and we will check the
value in every case so if the case is

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:05.430
equal to 1, 2 or 12 the season is equal
to winter and we add a break to finish

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:13.170
these cases after that we can add the
following cases the case 3 4 and 5 in

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:19.170
these cases the season is equal to spring
and we can add a break to finish these

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.180
cases if we don't add a break because it
is optional the flow of the switch

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.700
statement will continue executing the
next cases sometimes this logic is

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.209
necessary but most of the
cases we need to add a break to finish

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:42.750
every case once it's executed. We add the
following cases case 6 7 and 8

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:52.900
in this cases the season is equal to
summer and we add a break. case 9 case

00:02:52.900 --> 00:03:03.040
10 and case 11 the season is equal to
autumn and we add a break. And the default

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:12.099
case the season is equal to Incorrect
Month. We close the switch and add to the

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:19.450
log the season for the month is equal to
the season that we have selected we

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.329
close the main method and we close the
class

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:28.060
and because the month in this case is
equal to 11 the season will be equal to

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:37.470
autumn so we will execute the project to
check this result so execute the project

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:45.519
right click on the class and run file
and the result is the season for the

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:51.819
month 1 is equal to winter but if the
value is equal to 11 the season is equal

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:59.889
to Autumn. With this exercise we have put
into practice the handling of the switch

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:04.660
structure these are the control
sentences that we will be using when

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.470
working with Java
