00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:16.570
Logical Operators. In addition to the
operators already mentioned we will use

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.099
logical operators so that in combination
with the control structures we can

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:25.809
create decisions that provide a
solution to our needs. In the table you

00:00:25.809 --> 00:00:30.910
can see the logical operators with which
we will be working. Unless we want to

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:36.550
work with bits (ones and zeros) we will
normally use the AND (&amp;&amp;) and OR (||) operators

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:42.780
in short circuit mode. In the following
table we will explain what this means

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.429
Truth table of logical operators. In the
figure we can see the application of the

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:53.769
logical operators and the truth table
that applies to each operator. This table

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:58.239
must be known by heart, since it is what
we'll be applying when we use the

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:04.150
logical operators. The 1 means true and
the 0 means false, however is not

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:09.460
difficult to memorize, the only thing we
have to apply is the following. In the

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.770
case of the operator AND (&amp;&amp;) the result
will be true only if both values are

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:21.460
true, otherwise the final result will be
false. In the case of the OR (||) operator the

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:28.149
result will be true if any of the
operands X or Y is true. Above we

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:34.119
mentioned the AND and short-circuit OR
operators, what it means is that if it's

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:39.939
detected that a result no longer makes
sense to evaluate it, for example if the

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:45.520
operator AND the evaluation of the
operand on the left side is false then

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.289
the whole expression will be false and
the remaining operand will no longer be

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:55.600
evaluated. And in the case of the OR
operator if the operand on the left side

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.880
is true therefore the other operand on
the right side is no longer evaluated

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.789
because the whole result will be true
and in the case of the negation operator

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:11.650
the only thing it does is to invert the
original value of the operand so it will

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.300
be very simple to apply this truth table
for each of the operators if we apply

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.040
the rules described. In the next
exercises we will practice this kind of

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.049
operators in
combination with the control structures

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:33.500
Relational Operators. When using the
decision structures we will find the need

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.829
to compare values, that's why we will use
different types of operators for this

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:43.459
relational operators are listed on the
figure and we will put them into

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.209
practice in combination with the
decision structures in the following

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.989
exercises
