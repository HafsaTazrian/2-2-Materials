00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:19.100
Hello my name is Ubaldo Acosta. I hope
you're ready to begin, let's review the

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:30.289
general agenda of Java Server Faces
course. Are you ready? let's go. Getting

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:36.980
Started: Introduction to JavaServer Faces. In
this section will study an introduction

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.470
to JavaServer Faces technology. We'ill review
what JavaServer Faces is, we'll also study

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.640
the characteristics of this technology.
We'll see a 3-layer architecture and

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.909
the role of JSF in this Java
architecture. We'll see how JSF

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:57.769
implements the MVC (Model-View-Controller)
design pattern. We will also carry out

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:01.909
the installation of the tools that we
will use throughout the course and we'll

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:09.950
create a first HelloWorld project with
JSF. Basic Concepts: Managed Beans in

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.650
JSF. in this section we will review
the concept of managed beans in JSF, also

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:21.980
the scopes of the Managed Beans in JSF, both
using the JSF standard and the Java EE

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:28.100
standard using the concept of CDI
(Context and Dependency Injection). We'll

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.350
also see how to inject Manage Beans
dependencies with the JSF standard such

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:39.950
as using the standard in Java EE using
CDI. Likewise, we'll study the concept of

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:45.980
Expression Language (EL) in JSF and how to
apply it to our JSF pages. We'll review

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:52.460
the faces-config.xml file that is
the JSF configuration file and we'll do

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:58.460
several exercises to implement the
Managed Bean concepts in JSF. Flow

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.950
between Pages: Navigation with JSF. We'll
review the concept of navigation or flow

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:11.390
between JSF pages and how it is
implemented in JSF. We'll review how

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.980
to define this concept explicitly: Static Navigation using the faces-config.xml

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.739
file and in implicitly: Dynamic
Navigation, which is the form we'll use

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:27.709
most
often. Validation of data: Validations in

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:32.300
JSF. In this section we'll study the
validation issue when sending

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:37.280
information to the server using the JSF
forms. These are the standard validations,

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.910
validations in the methods of the
managed beans, and personalized

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.920
validations. We'll carry out an exercise to
put this concept of validators into

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:53.330
practice in JSF. Conversion of Data:
Conversions in JSF.

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.140
In this section we'll analyze the
concept of Conversion in JSF. The

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.030
converters cover the need to assign and
convert values between the JSF pages and

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:07.010
the attributes of the Managed Beans
automatically. We'll study the implicit

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.989
and explicit converters, as well as the
custom converters and we'll create an

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:19.430
exercise to implement the converters in
JSF. Capturing events: Management of

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:25.160
Events in JSF. Will see the topic of
event management in JSF. This concept

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:30.519
allow us to capture events when there are
changes in the JSF pages, in the view, and

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:35.930
execute a method in the managed bean. There are different types of events that

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.370
we can detect. One of them is the valueChangeListener and another

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.700
actionListener. We'll do several exercises to
put this concept into practice

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.810
Presentation. Facelets in JSF.
We'll review the technology of the facelets

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:58.820
in JSF. We'll see the
characteristics. Presentation: Facelets

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.109
in JSF. We'll review a technology
of the phase let's enjoy yourself we'll

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:07.250
see the characteristics of this
technology and why they are the standard

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.510
today instead of JSP's. We'll also
see the concept of templates using

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:17.690
Facelets and create an exercise to put
this concept into practice. Integrating

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.680
all: Real-world web application with JSF
and Java EE

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:27.950
We will create a web application using
JSF and integrated it with Java EE by

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.060
deploying it in a Java application
server. This application will have a

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.080
3-layer architecture and we'll
define perfectly the role of each

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.840
technology in this practical application.
JSF in the presentation layer,

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.710
integrating it with EJB in the
business layer and integrating it with

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:50.300
JPA in the data layer. This application
will serve as the basis for your own

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:59.270
Java Web and Enterprise applications
using JSF and Java EE. Broadly speaking

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:03.710
this is the general agenda of the JavaServer
Faces course. These are just some of the

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.490
many more topics we learned throughout
this course so if you're ready let's

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:10.240
start immediately :)
