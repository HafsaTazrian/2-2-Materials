00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:20.660
My name is Ubaldo Acosta. I hope you're
ready to begin. Let's review the general

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:26.680
agenda of the Hibernate Framework course.
Are you ready? let's go

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:32.660
Starting: Introduction to Hibernate
Framework and JPA. In this section will

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.379
study an introduction to Hibernate
Framework and JPA and how these two

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:40.670
technologies are related. We'll also see
the concept of Object Relational Mapping (ORM)

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:46.460
and is the model on which Hibernate and
JPA are based. We'll also review an

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.089
architecture of 3 business layers
and we'll see the role played by

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:55.129
Hibernate and JPA within this enterprise
architecture. Will also carry out the

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:58.460
installation of the tools that we're
going to use throughout the course and

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:04.989
will create a first HelloWorld project
using Hibernate Framework and JPA

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.159
The basis: Basic Operations with
Hibernate and JPA.

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:14.780
In this section we'll review the basic
operations with hibernate and JPA. These

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.820
basic operations are select data, insert,
update and delete data. We'll do an

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:27.020
exercise to put this concept into
practice. Relationships: Management of

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.670
associations with Hibernate and JPA. We'll
review the concept of association

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.020
management with hibernate and JPA.
We'll create an entity relationship

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.390
scheme where we'll review the types of
associations with hibernate and JPA. We'll

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.250
review the associations of one-to-one
one-to-many and many-to-many

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:53.150
relationships. We'll create an exercise to
put this associations into practice. State

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.300
Management: Life cycle in Hibernate and
JPA

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:01.400
in this section we'll analyze the life
cycle of entity objects when we use

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.659
Hibernate and JPA.
We'll see how to persist an object, how

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:09.140
to recover it, how to modify it and how
to delete it.

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.180
We'll carry out an exercise to put into
practice the life cycle of entity

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.569
objects

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.400
More Topics: Cascade Persistence with
Hibernate and JPA.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.990
In this section we'll study the concept
of cascade persistence which is one of

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:32.050
the topics that can help us when we want
to persist an entity object. We'll create an

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:38.980
exercise to put this concept into
practice. Queries: Queries with Hibernate and

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.590
JPA. We'll see the topic of queries when
working with hibernate and JPA. In

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.240
Hibernate this language is known as
hibernate query language (HQL) and in JPA is

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:54.400
known as Java Persistence Query Language (JPQL). Will see
the characteristics of these languages

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:01.840
and in turn we'll perform several exercises
to put this concept into practice. More

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.990
Queries. Criteria API with Hibernate and
JPA. in addition to HQL and JPQL

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:12.850
languages there is Criteria API which
you can also extract information from the

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:18.610
database using this API.
However this Criteria API is commonly

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:25.570
used to create dynamic queries with Java
code, instead of strings like HQL or JPQL

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:30.040
languages. We will create several
exercises to implement this type of

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:37.660
queries. Integrating Everything: Real
world web application with Hibernate and

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.510
JPA.
We'll create an application called

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.400
Student Management System which will
integrate everything seen in the course,

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.110
from basic topics to more advanced
topics of Hibernate and JPA. This

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:54.010
application will have a 3-layer
architecture and will perfectly define

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.750
the role of each technology in this
practical application which will serve

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.160
as the basis for your own with Java Web
and Enterprise Applications using

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.510
Hibernate and JPA.

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:11.470
Broadly speaking, this is the general
agenda of the Hibernate and JPA course.

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.250
These are just some of the many more
topics we'll learn throughout this

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:28.720
course. So, if you are ready, let's begin :)
