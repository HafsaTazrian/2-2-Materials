Hello, my name is Ubaldo Acosta. I hope
you're ready to begin. Let's review the

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:26.939
general agenda of the Java Fundamentals
course. Are you ready? let's begin.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.430
Starting: The Java Technology. In this
section we will study the main features

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.980
of the Java language, the origin and
evolution of this fabulous language. We

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.420
will also review the different products
and versions offered by Java technology.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.030
We will also install the tools that
we'll use throughout the course,

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.739
including the Java Development Kit (JDK)
and we'll create the first HelloWorld

00:00:53.739 --> 00:01:02.679
Java project. Basic Components: Variables
and Operators. In this section we'll

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:06.940
review the concept of variables in Java
as well as the data types that this

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.440
programming language offers to us. We'll
create some exercises to put this

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.930
concept into practice, also examine the
types of operators that Java offered to

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.520
us, as well as the reserved words of the
Java language. We'll create some

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.469
exercises to implement the use of
operators and we'll check the operator

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:34.329
precedence in Java. Basic Structures:
Control Sentences. We'll review the

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:40.119
control statements like if else and
switch, the syntax of each one, as well as

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:44.380
some exercises to put this concept into
practice. We also review more Java

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:52.420
operators which are constantly used with
the if or switch statements. Basic

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.460
Structures: Control Flow Statements.
In this section we'll analyze the while,

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.710
do while and for statement in Java.
We'll study the syntax of each one and

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:09.850
create several exercises to learn each
one of these concepts. Object-Oriented

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:15.160
Programming: Java Classes and Objects. In
this section we'll study the concept of

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.790
classes and objects in Java.
We'll see the general structure to

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.560
create a class in Java and the syntax to
create objects from

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.840
a class. These concepts are pillars in Java
technology. We'll create many exercises to

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:34.590
put this concept into practice. Functions:
Methods in Java. We'll define what a

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.440
method is, as well as the syntax in Java
to create methods. We'll see how to make

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:46.040
method calls and create an exercise to
implement this important concept in Java.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:52.620
Data Handling: Arrays in Java. We'll study
the concept of Arrays of one and two

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.269
dimensions in Java. Both concepts are
the most basic data structures that

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:02.069
we'll use in your Java projects. We'll
also create several exercises to work

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:10.230
with these concepts. Class Design:
Inheritance and Encapsulation: We'll

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.120
learn the concept of inheritance in Java
and how to put this important concept

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.220
into practice in our projects. We'll also
review the concept of encapsulation and

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.590
how to apply it to our Java classes. This
is the general agenda of the Java

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.970
Fundamentals course. These are just some
of the many more topics that we'll learn

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:36.410
throughout this course. So, if you're
ready to begin let's start immediately :)
