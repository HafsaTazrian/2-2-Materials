Exercise. Installing the JDK on Windows

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:28.880
Exercise Objective.
In this exercise we'll proceed to

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.240
install the Java Development Kit.
We'll cover the process of downloading

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:40.670
and installing the JDK. Download the
JDK. Go to the next URL and download the

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.320
JDK, select the platform that correspond
to the operating system that you use. In

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:53.570
this case We select the windows x64
option. In step 2: Installing the JDK. Once

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.100
the file is downloaded we double-click
to open the Installer. The process is

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:05.960
very similar to any other operating
system. Installing the JDK: The Installer

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.550
opens and click on Next

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:16.580
Next we'll see the installation path of
the JDK. Here, you can modify it, but we'll

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:24.799
leave the default values and click on
next. We wait for the installation to

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:32.630
finish. As part of the JDK (Java
Development Kit) installation the JRE

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.340
Java Runtime Environment will be
installed too. Here you can change the

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:45.979
installation path, but we leave the
default values and click on Next. We wait

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:53.630
for the Java Runtime environment
installation to finish. Click on Close

00:01:53.630 --> 00:02:03.140
and we conclude the installation of the
JDK and Java Runtime Environment (JRE). In this

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.950
exercise we have installed the Java
Development Kit (JDK) and the Java Runtime

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.150
Environment (JRE) in order to use the Java
language in our computer. For more

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.800
details of Java installation on other
platforms or operating systems you can
