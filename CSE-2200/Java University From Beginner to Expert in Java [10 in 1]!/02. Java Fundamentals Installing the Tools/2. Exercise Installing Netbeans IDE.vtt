Exercise: Installing NetBeans
IDE on Windows. Exercise Objective. In

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.180
this exercise we'll proceed to install
the Integrated Development Environment

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:33.130
(IDE) of NetBeans. Will cover the process
of downloading and installing NetBeans

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:40.840
Download the NetBeans IDE. Go to
the following link and download NetBeans

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:48.940
Select the platform you use. In this case
we'll select NetBeans for Windows option

00:00:51.490 --> 00:01:01.820
Once the file is downloaded we'll double 
click to open the Installer. Before we

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:11.780
install the IDE, we can customize it.
We click on Customize button. Deselect

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.520
GlassFish server and click OK. This is
because we will install a newer version

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.290
of this Java Application Server. If you
don't know what an Application Server is

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:31.130
don't worry, we'll cover it later in the
course. Installing NetBeans IDE. Once

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.850
we have finished customizing the
installation, click on Next to continue.

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:47.270
Accept the license agreement and click on
Next.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.250
If necessary rename the installation path
of NetBeans as shown below. The JDK path

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.530
is selected automatically and click on
Next, but we leave the default values and

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:05.600
click on Next
Accept the default values and click on

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:18.709
install. The installation process starts.
It takes a few minutes to finish. The

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:27.260
installation ends and click on Finish. Go
to programs to open NetBeans, we search

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:38.440
for NetBeans IDE 8.2. The NetBeans
IDE starts.

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:45.170
The start page shows up. You can deselect on Show on StartUp and close

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:53.930
the start page. Finally the NetBeans
IDE is ready to use. We finish the

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.579
installation process of NetBeans,

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.370
Exercise Conclusion: With this exercise
we have installed the tools that we'll

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.689
use throughout the course. It's worth
mentioning that is possible to use even

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:13.819
a Notepad, however the idea is to use
real-world tools and with more

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:17.659
experience you can select the
development tool Integrated Development

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:21.980
Environment that suits you best.
