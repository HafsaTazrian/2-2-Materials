Hello, my name is Ubaldo Acosta. I hope
you're ready to begin. Let's review the

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:28.449
general agenda of the Java JDBC course.
Are you ready? let's begin. Starting:

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:33.620
Introduction to JDBC. In this section we
will see an introduction to the SQL

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:39.170
language and the JDBC technology. Both
technologies are what we'll be using

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.820
throughout the course. We'll also carry
out the installation of the tools and

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.650
databases that we'll be using throughout
the course. In turn, we'll create the first

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:56.989
Java project using JDBC. Connecting to
the database with JDBC: Handling

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:02.900
connections. In this section we'll review in
more detail the management of JDBC. We'll

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.940
see the driver concept to connect to a
database using Java with JDBC. We'll also

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.860
review the types of sentences that we
have available in JDBC to communicate

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.240
with the database. Likewise, we will
review the handling of exceptions in

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:25.210
JDBC and create some exercises to put
into practice the management of JDBC

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:32.840
Reading data: Select statements. We'll review
the statements with JDBC that will allow

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:40.640
us to read data from the database, that
is: the Select statement. Manipulating

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.580
data: Inserting, updating and deleting
data. in this section we'll see the JDBC

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.200
statement that will allow us to insert
update and delete information from a

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.780
database. We'll study the syntax of each
one and create several exercises to

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:05.510
learn each one of this concept. Knowing
the structure: Metadata. In this section

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:10.550
we'll define the concept of metadata and
see how it can help us in our programs

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:16.690
with JDBC. We'll create several exercises
to put this concept into practice.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.629
Executing Functions:
Store procedures. We'll define what

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:25.680
Store procedure is and what a function
is in a database.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.540
We'll use the Oracle database as a
database manager to execute a method and

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.730
a store procedure in Oracle from Java
using JDBC. We'll create several

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:43.079
exercises to put this concept into
practice. Structuring our code. Data

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:49.859
layer. We'll learn the concept of data layer
and we create an example using JDBC. This

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:55.349
is an important concept when we are
working with JDBC. Applying best

00:02:55.349 --> 00:03:00.269
practices: Design patterns in the data
layer. We'll study the design pattern

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:06.269
concept and will apply some design
patterns like DAO (Data Access Object) and

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:12.359
DTO (Data Transfer Object). These are
design patterns and we will add them to

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:17.010
our data layer. We'll also see how to
create a pool of connections to our

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.239
connectivity with a database and we'll
see how to connect to different

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:26.370
databases such as MySql and Oracle
at the same time. We'll create several

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:32.010
exercises to make this concept clear.
This is the general agenda of the Java

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.540
JDBC course. These are just some of the
many more topics that we'll learn

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.150
throughout this course. So, if you're
ready, let's begin :)
