00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.930
Hello, my name is Ubaldo Acosta. I hope
you're ready to begin. Let's review the

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:29.660
general agenda of a Struts Framework
course. Are you ready? let's begin.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.309
Starting: Introduction to Struts
Framework. In this section we'll study an

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:38.660
introduction to Struts Framework. We'll
review this MVC (Model-View-Controller)

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.809
Java framework that has included a 3-layer architecture that can simplify

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:49.159
considerably a Java Web application. We'll
also carry out the installation of the

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:53.180
tools we are going to use throughout the
course, and will create the first Hello

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.979
World project with Struts framework

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:03.620
Basic Concepts: Conventions in Struts
framework. In this section we'll review

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.270
the concept of using conventions in
Struts. Many of the configurations using

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.100
Struts has been simplified and we're
going to use as many conventions as we

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.120
can in order to simplify the
configuration when using Struts

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:24.710
Framework. Actions: Actions in the Struts
framework. The Actions in Struts are the

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:30.500
most important part as every web request
ends in a component called Action. We'll

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.210
see what an action is, how to configure
it and many more topics related to this

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.040
important concept in Struts Framework

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:46.670
Messages: Messages (Resource Bundle) in Struts. in this section will show the

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:52.040
concept of messages. The messages are the labels that are used in a web

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.690
applications, and we'll see that these
labels can be included in different

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.670
languages, not just the default language
but any language that we want our

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.110
application to be translated. We'll create
some exercises to put this concept into

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:13.519
practice. Flow between pages. Results in
Struts. In this section we'll study the

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:19.069
concept of Results in Struts. A result is
used to decide where to go when an

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:25.819
action ends, so you can go to a web page,
another action, send an Excel, PDF, Audio,

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:31.310
Video or any other kind of document or
any other result that is supported by

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.269
Struts Framework. We'll create several
exercises to put this concept into

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:42.110
practice. Annotations: Annotations in
Struts. Many of the previous

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.810
configuration using Struts were made
using XML files but with annotations we

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.159
can simplify and reduce XML
configurations to zero. So, in this

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:55.730
chapter, we'll see many of the
annotations that we can use when working

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:02.569
with Struts Framework. Data
validation and conversion: Data

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:06.590
Validation and Convention in Struts.
We'll review the concept of validation

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.879
and convention in Struts Framework.
We'll see how easy is to implement these

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:14.810
concepts because the struts already has
included many conventions and

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.890
validations automatically and
implementing these concepts is a matter

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:24.440
of extending a class or implementing
an interface in our Action Classes. We'll

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:32.690
create an exercise to pull this concept
into practice. Integrating All: Creation

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.010
of a real world web application. We'll
create an application called a Student

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.599
Management System (SMS) which will integrate
everything seen in the course from basic

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:46.069
topics to more advanced topics of
Struts Framework. This application will

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:49.700
have a 3-layer architecture and will
perfectly define the role of each

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:54.199
technology in this practical application,
which will serve as the basis for your

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:58.699
own Java Web applications using Struts
and other technologies like Spring or

00:03:58.699 --> 00:04:06.680
Hibernate Framework or even EJB's and
JPA Java EE technologies. Broadly

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.849
speaking, this is the general agenda of
the Struts Framework course. These are

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:14.780
just some of the many more topics we
will learn throughout this course. So if you are

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.739
ready, let's begin :)
