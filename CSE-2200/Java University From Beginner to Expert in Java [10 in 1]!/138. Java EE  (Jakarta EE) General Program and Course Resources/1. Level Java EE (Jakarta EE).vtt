00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.880
My name is Ubaldo Acosta. I hope you're
ready to begin. Let's review the general

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:26.080
agenda of the Java Enterprise Edition
course. Are you ready? let's go

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.460
Starting: Introduction to Java EE. In this
section we'll study an introduction to

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:37.059
Java Enterprise Technology (Java EE). We'll
see: What is an enterprise application?

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:43.670
what is Java EE? and several of the API's
that includes it. We'll look at the history

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.650
of Java Enterprise versions from the
time J2EE was named to the current

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:54.860
evolution known as Jakarta EE, and we'll
mention the architecture which will work

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.570
throughout the course. We'll also carry out
the installation of the tools that we'll

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.379
use throughout the course and we'll
create a first hello world project with

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:10.400
Java EE. EJB's:
Enterprise JavaBeans: In this section

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.950
we'll review what Enterprise JavaBeans
are. We'll see the characteristics of a

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.830
EJB's, the configuration and the types
of EJB's that exist in Java EE. We'll

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.660
also review the way to communicate with
an EJB by creating a Java client

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:32.240
Likewise, we'll review the differences
between EJB and EJB Light, since it's

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:38.720
possible to deploy the EJB's in a web
server or full Java servers. We'll do

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.940
several exercises to put these concepts
into practice

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.140
Persistence: Java Persistence API. We'll
review the Java Persistence API

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.570
concept in Java EE. We'll study the
characteristics of the JPA and the role

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.040
they fulfill within a Java EE
architecture. We'll see the concept of

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.260
Entity Classes and the concept of Entity
Manager and Persistence Unit. We'll create

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:11.709
several exercises to put these issues
into practice. Servlets and JSP's:

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:16.459
Integration with Servlets and JSPs. In
this section we'll analyze the

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:20.780
Integration of Servlet technology and
JavaServer Pages technologies within

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.830
Java EE.
We'll see how to use EJB's within

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.570
Servlets and we'll apply the MVC design
pattern to implement this integration of

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:36.560
business technologies. JSF:
Integration with JavaServer Faces. In

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.810
this section will student integration of
technologies between JSF and Java EE. The

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.970
JavaServer faces layer will be extended
with the PrimeFaces API, which is one of

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:52.610
the most used JSF extension today. We
will create an exercise with a 3

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.500
layer architecture and implement the
integration between JSF, Primefaces, EJB's

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:07.070
and JPA. Intercommunication: Web Services
(SOAP and REST) we will see the topic of

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.240
Web Services in Java EE. There are
different ways to create Web Services

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:18.350
with Java EE, such as SOAP Web Services
(JAX-WS API) and REST Web Services (JAX-RS

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:24.500
API). We'll see how to create web services
with this API's, and also the client of

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.850
these Web Services. We'll do several
exercises to put these concepts into

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:37.130
practice. Security: Security in Java EE. We'll
review the security topic in Java EE

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:42.230
will add security to our web interface
to our EJB's

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.690
and Web Services. In addition, to validate
each of the clients to pass the security

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.080
established by the application will
create several exercises to put this

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:58.700
concept into practice. Integrating All:
Creation of real-world web application

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:06.739
with JSF, PrimeFaces, AJAX,  EJB, JPA, Web
Services and Security. We'll create an

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:11.180
application which will integrate
everything seen in the course from basic

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.110
topics to more advanced topics. This
application will have a 3-layer

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:20.090
architecture and will perfectly define
the role of each technology in this

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.800
practical application which will serve
as the basis for your own Java and

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.330
enterprise applications using
technologies such as JSF with Prime

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:35.550
Faces, including AJAX, EJB's and their
clients, Web Services and its Customers

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:42.900
and all adding security in our Java EE
application. Broadly speaking this is a

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.130
general agenda of the Java EE course
these are just some of the many more

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:50.820
topics we'll learn throughout this
course, so if you're ready, let's start

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.630
immediately :)
