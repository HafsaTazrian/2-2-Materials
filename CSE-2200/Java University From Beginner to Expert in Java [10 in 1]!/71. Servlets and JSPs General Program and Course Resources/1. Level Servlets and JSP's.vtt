00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.970
hello my name is Ubaldo Acosta. I hope
you're ready to begin. Let's review the

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:25.860
general agenda of the Servlets and JSP's
course. Are you ready? let's go

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.800
Starting: Introduction to web
applications. In this section we'll study

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.010
an introduction to web applications,
we'll review a 3-layer architecture

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:42.250
and the role of web applications in Java,
we'll also review the process of an HTTP

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.899
request in a web application. We'll also
carry out the installation of the tools

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:50.980
we're going to use throughout the course
and we'll create a first HelloWorld

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:59.440
project with Servlets. Knowing the basis.
Basic Concepts of Servlets.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.850
In this section we'll review the Servlets
concept, the role of this technology in

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.140
an enterprise Java application, as well
as the functions performed by a Servlet

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.479
We'll review the life cycle of a servlet.
We'll see some methods of the HTTP

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:18.549
protocol like GET and POST, which will
use a lot in the servlet programming.

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:25.540
We'll do an exercise to put these
concepts into practice. Client-Server

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:31.330
Interaction. Session Management with
Servlets. We'll review the concept of HTTP

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.130
Sessions. We'll see the forms offered by
the servlet API for the management of a

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.840
session. We'll create an exercise of a
shopping car to put this topic into

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.320
practice

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:51.159
Starting with JSP's. Introduction to JSP's.
In this section we'll analyze an

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:56.860
introduction to JavaServer Pages
technology or better known as JSP. We'll

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.119
study the benefits of using JSP
compared to Servlets. We'll see the role

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:04.270
of the JSP technology in a Java Web
application.

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.820
Likewise, we'll review the lifecycle of
the JSP. We'll carry out an exercise to

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:14.400
put into practice the use of the JSP

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.819
More Topics:
JavaBeans in JSP's and more topics. In this

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.840
section we'll study several of the
elements that we'll use with a JSP's

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.090
We'll also review the concept of
directives in JSP, the inclusion of files

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.800
and the use of JavaBeans in the JSP's. We'll create several exercises to

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:41.790
put all these concepts into practice.
Advanced: Advanced Topics on Servlets and

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.800
JSP's. We'll see several advanced topics
of Servlets and JSP's since we'll begin

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.670
to integrate these technologies to
create a robust presentation layer for

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.380
our enterprise and web applications with
Java. Will also see topics such as

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.690
Expression Language (EL) of the JSP's as
well as the JSTL library of the JSP's

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:08.760
We'll do several exercises to put
these concepts into practice. Java

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:14.340
Architecture. MVC Design Pattern using
Servlets and JSP's. We'll review the MVC

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.060
(Model-View-Controller) design pattern
which will be the basis for structuring

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.440
our presentation layer for our web
applications with Java using Servlets

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.600
technology and JSP's. We'll see what
role each technology plays in this

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.470
design pattern and we will create an
exercise to pull this concept into

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:39.840
practice. Integrating All. Creation of
real-world web Application. We'll create

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.070
an application called a Student
Management System (SMS) which will integrate

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:49.290
everything seen in the course, from basic
topics to more advanced topics of

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:54.660
Servlets and JSP's. This application will
have a 3-layer Architecture and we'll

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.890
perfectly define the role of each
technology in this practical application,

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.840
which will serve as the basis for your
own Java Web Applications using Servlets

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:12.030
and JSP's. Broadly speaking, this is the
general agenda of the course Servlets

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.410
and JSP's. These are just some of the many
more topics that we'll learn throughout

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.930
this course. So, if you're ready, let's
begin :)
