Hello, my name is Ubaldo Acosta. I hope
you're ready to begin. Let's review the

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:27.050
general agenda of the HTML CSS and
JavaScript course. Are you ready? let's

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:35.750
begin. Starting: Introduction to HTML. In
this section we'll explain an introduction

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.370
to HTML.
We'll also carry out the installation of

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.659
the tools that we'll use throughout the
course, and we'll create the first Hello

00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:54.140
World with HTML project. Knowing the basis:
HTML Components. In this section we'll

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.070
review several of the most common
elements that we will use when using

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:04.729
HTML: text components, lists, hyperlinks,
inclusion of images, among several other

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:09.740
components. We'll create several exercises
to put into practice each of these

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:18.500
concepts. Knowing the Styles: Introduction
to CSS. We'll review an introduction to CSS

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.870
(Cascade Style Sheet). We'll also review 
the concept of DOM (Document Object Model)

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:30.200
to understand how CSS Styles work. We'll
create an exercise to start with the use

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:39.590
of CSS Styles. Applying Design: Use of CSS
Styles. In this section we'll review the

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.270
types of selectors we have in CSS and
create an exercise to understand these

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:53.120
concepts. Combining Technologies. Tables
and Forms with HTML and CSS. In this

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:59.360
session we'll use tables in HTML as well
as define what an HTML form is and we'll

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.220
apply CSS styles to these forms to
beautify them. We'll create several

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:11.480
exercises to put this concept into
practice. Knowing JS: Introduction to

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.040
JavaScript. We'll study an introduction to
JavaScript. We'll see the utilities of

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.980
this language, as well as the scope of it
within the web pages. We'll also see the

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.239
role that JavaScript plays in an enterprise

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.829
application. We'll create an exercise to
see how to integrate JavaScript with our

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:36.120
HTML pages. Structuring our code.
Functions with JavaScript. We'll learn the

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.829
concept of functions with JavaScript at
the end JavaScript adds dynamism to our

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:45.420
HTML pages and this behavior will be
encapsulated in JavaScript functions

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:52.549
we'll do an exercise to put this concept
into practice. Combining technologies:

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:59.489
HTML CSS and JavaScript. We'll see how to
integrate the three HTML, CSS and

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:04.079
JavaScript technologies in a single
project. We'll create a form which

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:07.680
integrates the three technologies and at
the end of the exercise

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:14.760
we'll have integrated the three
technologies in a single project. Broadly

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.549
speaking, this is the general agenda of
the course of HTML CSS and JavaScript

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:24.000
These are just some of the many more
topics that we'll learn throughout this

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:37.249
course. So, if you're ready, let's begin :)
