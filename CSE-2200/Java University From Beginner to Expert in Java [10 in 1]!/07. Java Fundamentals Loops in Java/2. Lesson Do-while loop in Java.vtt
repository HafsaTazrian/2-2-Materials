00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:22.529
flow diagram do-while loop sometimes is
desirable that the code to be repeated

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.710
can be executed at least once before the
end of the loop for this the do-while

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.899
loop has been created it's sometimes
desirable to evaluate the condition at

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.180
the end of the loop instead of at the
beginning because of this this loop

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.250
evaluates the code to be repeated at
least once and in each iteration the

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.770
code to be repeated is executed first
and then the condition is evaluated to

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:58.950
know if the loop continues or not syntax
do-while loop the dowhile loop in Java

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:04.229
is not obligatory to use curly braces in
case there is only one line to execute

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.920
but if the while loop is going to
execute more than one code statement

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.979
then it must carry curly braces as we
can see because the condition of the

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.499
do-while loop is evaluated at the end
the block of code to be repeated will be

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:25.439
executed at least once even if this
condition is not true in the exercises

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.249
that we're going to develop later we
will put this do-while loop into

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:31.729
practice

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.369
