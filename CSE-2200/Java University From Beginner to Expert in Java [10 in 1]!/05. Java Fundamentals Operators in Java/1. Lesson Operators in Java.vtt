00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.789
hello welcome again I hope you're ready
to start with this lesson we will study

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:21.180
the issue of operators this is the basis
for the management of information when

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.320
creating our programs in Java and
operating with the data are you ready ok

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:34.390
let's go. In order to perform any type of
calculation and/or create our algorithms

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.670
is necessary to use operators in the
table shown we can observe the operators

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:45.370
in Java from arithmetic operators
relationship operators logical unitary

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:51.249
operators bit-level operators assignment
operators conditional priority and

00:00:51.249 --> 00:00:56.109
evaluation order operators so this is
the table that we're going to use as a

00:00:56.109 --> 00:01:00.999
reference so we are going to do some
exercises to put these operators into

00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:07.570
practice. Reserve Words in Java. When
working with Java the language has

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.040
previously defined several words that
already have a particular meaning for

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.380
the compiler and therefore we cannot use
them for purposes of assigning a name to

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.270
a variable. In the figure we can see the
reserved words in Java and little by

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.310
little we will know many of these words
and the meaning of each of them, however

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.869
in this picture we can see all of them
concentrated so we have a general

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:35.860
knowledge of these words and these words
have been reserved by the Java language

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:41.520
so this picture can serve us for a
future reference
