00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.360
Java Standard Edition Versions

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:18.740
Next we'll see the different versions of
the standard version of Java.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.300
In 1996 Java was born, originally called OAK.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:30.760
In 1997 the version 1.1 arises in which it
includes the first visual form of Java known

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:39.260
as AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit), among several
other APIs.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:45.290
An API (Application Programming Interface)
and is a set of classes and libraries to solve

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:51.530
a specific problem, for example the JDBC API
that allows us to connect to a database, among

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.280
several other APIs.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.320
We'll see the evolution of the Java Standar Versions.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.900
One of the most important changes in the Java
versions was made in the version

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.360
5 version and the Java version 8.

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:10.830
In the java version 5 the concept of Generics
was introduced, which changed the way we did

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.380
conversion between Java objects, assigning
a specific type to be used especially when

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.330
working with collections.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.570
This eliminated many of the execution errors
when handling object types and specifying

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.049
the type of data a collection should contain.

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:30.509
And the biggest change for java, not only
because of the years that have passed and

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:36.799
the language has matured, but because it also
implies a paradigm shift, is the inclusion

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:43.250
of lambda expressions, with which we can combine
the power of oriented programming to objects

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.890
with functional programming, that although
it is not a new paradigm, if it is something

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.680
new for Java programmers.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.130
I know that several of these concepts or topics
are new to many of the programmers that start

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:01.979
with Java, however many of this topics are precisely what we are going to study studying in this and the following

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:08.149
courses of their specialization in Java technology.

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:16.680
Although there are already version 9 and 10
of Java in the market, these versions are

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.130
not yet supported by application servers such
as Glassfish 5, therefore the version we will

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.200
use throughout the course will be the Java
SDK 8 version, which is the version currently

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.510
supported by most application tools and servers.

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.019
As we begin to support the current versions
of Java we'll begin to include them as they

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.960
apply to the real Java world.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:42.840
meanwhile it's our recommendation not to use it in production environment

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.880
because it's not supported for many of out tools that we use today

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.140
Current position of Java

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.440
As we can see today Java technology continues
to dominate the world of programming, and

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.510
this is just one of the reasons why studying
and mastering Java takes you one step ahead

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.470
of any competition you have along the way.

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.650
However, in many cases we have been told that
learning Java is very difficult, and that

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.480
is old fashion,  and it's not worth learning Java.

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.260
That it's not true. Because the market demands a lot of Java Programmers. So if you want

00:03:18.263 --> 00:03:19.700
to be able to incorporate

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.850
in the thousands of job opportunities,
both national and international generated

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:30.669
by the Java system development market, you have to be very well prepared in this language

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:34.980
And although there is a lot of competition
in the systems development market, there is

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.669
still a shortage of Java programmers, so there
will always be many opportunities for people

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:44.020
who are well prepared and specialized like
you

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.320
Java and the Software Industry

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.699
In addition to the features already described
in Java, it is important to mention several

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:55.299
other reasons why to be a Java expert.

00:03:55.299 --> 00:04:00.470
Fortunately, there is a community of millions
of Java programmers worldwide, this allows

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:05.150
fellow programmers to contribute knowledge
and solutions to many of the problems that

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:10.260
we can face on a day-to-day basis, and unlike
other languages ​​and / or development

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:15.410
platforms, in which knowledge is very closed,
the Java community contributes abundant free

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:20.729
content through the internet, so many solutions
can be found through these communities and

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:24.290
support forums that exist worldwide.

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:29.150
The support to Java that the large software
industries provide, allows Java to be the

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:34.620
number one option today when we are about
to select a new project, this in turn allows

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:40.490
excellent job opportunities to be generated
worldwide and although there are many programmers,

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:45.460
the demand for them far exceeds the number
of programmers needed to meet this demand.

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:50.220
This allows us to have a
lot of opportunities for our growth and professional

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:57.380
development. And if we are well prepared, there are a lot of opportunities in this market.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:02.880
In addition, learning Java facilitates learning
other programming languages, since good

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.250
practices, design patterns, frameworks and
other technologies that are generated due

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:12.370
to Java development are usually adopted by
other languages ​​and technologies to

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.850
also facilitate their software developments.

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:21.480
so, once Java is learned, it will be easier
to understand and communicate with other programmers

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.350
of other programming languages.

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:28.980
These are just some of the most important
reasons why to become a Java Expert.

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:34.030
With this we already have more clear both
the history, the main characteristics and

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:37.270
the reasons for which to master Java.
