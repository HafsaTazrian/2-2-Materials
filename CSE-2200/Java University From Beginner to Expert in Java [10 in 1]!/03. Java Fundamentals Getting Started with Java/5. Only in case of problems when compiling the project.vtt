Possible error of Compilation with
NetBeans

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.960
only in case of errors when combining
the project, you can try to clear the netbeans

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.340
cache. To find the cache path on
your PC, depending on the operating

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.410
system that you have, you can follow the
next steps. To see the NetBeans cache

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:43.020
path open NetBeans, go to Help and select
About. This shows us the catche

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.940
directory, according to the operating
system that we have. We take this path

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:57.690
and follow the next step. Once the path
is found, delete the cache folder. After

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.839
that, close and reopen NetBeans and try
to compile the project again. If it

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:08.670
doesn't work uninstall and reinstall
NetBeans again. As we said, these steps

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.350
are only in case of problems
