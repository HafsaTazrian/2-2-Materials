00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.210
Hello, my name is Ubaldo Acosta and welcome again.

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:20.160
In this first lesson we will study an introduction
of Java technology. We'll see what is the

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.539
Java language and why it is important to master
this technology nowadays.

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.840
One of the main reasons why becoming a Java
expert is that there is an incredible demand

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.989
for well-trained professionals in Java technology,
but few people are prepared to face these

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:40.179
challenges, so it is the best time for you
to take advantage and become an specialist

00:00:40.179 --> 00:00:42.100
once and for all.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.379
Throughout this lesson we will study, among
other topics, the different versions of Java,

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:50.660
and the evolution of this technology until
this day.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:56.329
Also, we will study the most important characteristics
of Java and the important reasons why Java

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:59.909
is considered the number one language in the
world today.

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:05.640
So, if you're ready, let’s start with this fabulous
journey in learning the most popular programming

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.720
language in the world, Java.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.140
Introduction to Java Tecnology.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.520
Java is more than a programming language,
it is a very complete technology and considered

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.660
as the number one option for many of the enterprise
developments today.

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.430
But let's start with the basic elements, so
in these lessons we will study Java as a programming

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.780
language developed by Sun Microsystems.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:37.299
I would like to tell you that although we
are going to see some historical points, it

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:43.020
is not our intention to make notes of obvious
things that can be found on the internet,

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.560
but only with the intention of putting them
in context, and have a general picture of

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.490
what we are going to learn.

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.909
Java was born in the early 90s, created by
James Gosling, with the aim of creating a

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.980
programming language to be used in the new
generation of smart devices.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:12.220
They tried to use C++ and extend it, however
this language was complicated and James Gosling

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:19.030
decided to create a new language called OAK,
later changed the name to Java (the legend

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.070
says that they decided to choose the name Java
due to the coffee they used to drink,

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.070
Java it's a type of coffee from Asia).

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:32.050
Whatever may have been the origin of the name,
Java is today a name that everyone who uses

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:38.580
a computer is aware of, either by its Java
Virtual Machine, or some Java plug-in, and

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.390
this is because many applications installed
on our computer use Java as a programming

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:44.390
language.

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.400
The success of Java was the possibility of
installing a component, known as Applet, in

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:55.370
a Web browser, and with the Internet boom
it was possible to extend this concept to

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.380
any Web page and start running Java applications
anywhere in the world.

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:05.340
Over the years, the success of Java, not only
in the internet but in the creation of enterprise

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:11.750
systems, made Oracle to put his eyes on this
technology, and finally in 2009 was acquired

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.430
by this mega software company.

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:20.420
It has been several years since Oracle's acquisition
of Java, and fortunately, the evolution of

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:26.110
language, tools and support from large companies,
as well as the community of Java programmers

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:32.250
(counted by millions around the world), continues
to make Java the number one language worldwide

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.080
for the creation of general-purpose software.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:42.040
So much so that Google based the Android operating
system on the Java language, creating an extension

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.860
of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) known as Dalvik.

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:51.420
For all the above, the support for Java technology
is not only still growing, but it’s back

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:56.840
in fashion thanks to the new versions, large
companies and their decision to continue creating

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.970
software based on this programming language,
as well as the incredible community of Java

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:09.740
programmers that remains faithful and adding
new followers day by day worldwide.
