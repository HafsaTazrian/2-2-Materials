00:00.210 --> 00:01.630
Best, best, parametres.

00:01.950 --> 00:08.760
So if you come across a problem that you want to run a single best case for multiple input values,

00:09.210 --> 00:17.670
then in that case, it's very easy to give multiple values and run the same best guess multiple times

00:17.670 --> 00:19.210
using best in Japan.

00:20.010 --> 00:26.580
So suppose you want to perform a logging best case and they want to pass different username and password

00:26.820 --> 00:29.610
to test different, different users.

00:30.150 --> 00:35.610
So in this case you can use test in Japan it and provide data using these parameters.

00:36.580 --> 00:40.690
Actually the better approach is to do using external data provider.

00:41.080 --> 00:45.970
But we are going to learn from the thing like how we can do the basic this in your family does.

00:46.000 --> 00:52.750
And then we will go on to the next part where we can get it from the data provider object and we can

00:52.750 --> 00:54.220
get it from the Excel as well.

00:55.460 --> 01:00.340
So that is the example, you know, and so we will be more closed.

01:04.970 --> 01:07.200
So let us open this one.

01:07.220 --> 01:09.320
This and you permit us or give.

01:09.320 --> 01:10.970
So I have ordered dinner.

01:10.970 --> 01:14.300
A desk is for my oversight search box.

01:14.510 --> 01:19.040
So I want to use the search functionality and that's due to four different search buttons.

01:19.400 --> 01:22.160
So that is how can I pass the baton with that?

01:22.580 --> 01:30.920
So here we are using this act by meters annotation and they're passing such textbooks, which is again

01:30.920 --> 01:35.570
and I are, which is the barometer of the disk is adequate.

01:36.140 --> 01:42.170
So here we are opening the browser, Chrome browser and launching the United Q automated.

01:43.250 --> 01:50.660
Then we are using send used to on send the values in the search boxes and that value is coming from

01:50.660 --> 01:51.440
this barometer.

01:51.950 --> 01:57.160
So actually from there we are getting this value is from our test and you don't excuse.

01:58.480 --> 02:02.560
So if you open this here in the middle.

02:02.830 --> 02:03.240
Yes.

02:03.250 --> 02:05.650
I think the value here as Adam.

02:06.460 --> 02:06.850
Okay.

02:07.180 --> 02:08.890
So now let's run this.

02:09.460 --> 02:12.310
So then you're using destiny to set up a value.

02:12.520 --> 02:16.470
You have to run this file and you have to run this suit.

02:17.380 --> 02:21.280
If you run individual this, it will give you an exceptionally blockbuster.

02:23.540 --> 02:25.100
Is something went wrong.

02:25.130 --> 02:27.760
Okay, this is not the name of the class.

02:28.130 --> 02:32.810
I have to give the name of the best class here, which is dense energy.

02:34.070 --> 02:35.960
Maran does.

02:37.690 --> 02:38.080
Okay.

02:38.170 --> 02:39.670
So let's run this one.

02:53.290 --> 02:53.680
Okay.

02:54.160 --> 02:56.020
We'll start Chrome browser now.

03:09.830 --> 03:15.410
So it will right up in this large box and click on the search button.

03:19.200 --> 03:19.640
Okay.

03:21.160 --> 03:27.740
So in this way we can pass the value from our testing you detect from inside and how many values we

03:27.740 --> 03:32.480
are passing for the barometer that many times the test case will execute.
